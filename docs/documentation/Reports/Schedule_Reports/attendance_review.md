Notes/Usage:

Useful for directing management focus to trends that may have a negative impact on the company. IE: The employee often calls in sick on a Monday or Friday.

Using the Attendance Review Report

The Attendance Review Report allows users to review employee attendance history for a given period of time by displaying a character for each worked day as well as each day with Other Activity Hours such as Vacation, Sick, Personal, or Jury Duty. Exceptions are also listed on the report to help managers identify trends in employee behavior, such as regularly leaving work early on a Friday or requesting every Third Wednesday of the Month off for various reasons.

As shown in the image above, the attendance review report displays a grid including all days for the selected date range. For each day, a single character is printed to indicate employee hours. If the employee worked on a given date, the Worked Day Character will be displayed. If the employee had other Activity Hours on a given date, the Other Activity Character will be displayed according to the report options.

In order to setup an Other Activity type to display on the report, the user must first select an Other Activity Type and then enter a character to be displayed on the report for dates with the other activity. For example, setting Other Activity #1 to Sick Time and Other Activity One Character to S would display an S on any date for which the employee had Sick Hours.

Technical Note: The Date Fields on the Attendance Review Report support only one character. With this in mind, the Worked Day Character will be displayed on any day with working hours, even if there were also Other Activity Hours on the day. If multiple Other Activity Types occur on a single day with no working hours, the Day Field will display the Other Activity Type Character for the Other Activity Type with the most Hours. If all Other Activity Types on a single day have the same number of hours, the first Other Activity Type that was entered in the system will be displayed on the report.

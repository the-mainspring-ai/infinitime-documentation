## Controlling Access to Reports from the Employee Module

InfiniTime allows administrators to control which reports employees can access from the Employee Module. You can either disable report access entirely or customize which reports are available through the Employee Module toolbar buttons.

### Employee Module Report Buttons

The Employee Module toolbar includes three default report buttons:

- **Print Timecard**: Displays the Timecard Detail Report with selectable date range
- **Print Schedule**: Shows the Postable Schedule Report with selectable date range
- **Print Accruals**: Displays the Employee Accruals Report showing accrual totals

### Configuring Report Access

#### Option 1: Disabling Report Access

To completely disable report access from the Employee Module:

1. Log in to the Manager Module
2. Navigate to the Report Library
3. For each report (Timecard Detail, Postable Schedule, and Employee Accruals):
   - Select the report
   - Click "Change"
   - Go to the Options tab
   - Uncheck the corresponding "Print from Employee Module..." option

When these options are disabled, the Employee Module buttons will display a message indicating no report is assigned.

#### Option 2: Customizing Available Reports

To change which reports are accessible from the Employee Module buttons:

1. Log in to the Manager Module
2. Navigate to the Report Library
3. For the report you want to change:
   - Select the current report
   - Click "Change"
   - Go to the Options tab
   - Uncheck the "Print from Employee Module..." option
4. Select the new report you want to assign:
   - Click "Change"
   - Go to the Options tab
   - Check the appropriate "Print from Employee Module..." option

This process can be repeated for each button to assign different reports as needed.

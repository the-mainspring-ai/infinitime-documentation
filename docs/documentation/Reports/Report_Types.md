## Accrual Posting

The Accrual Posting Report will display a list of all accrual posting
records for the employees over a specific period of time.  An accrual
posting includes both individual dates on which an employee earned hours,
including the number of hours accrued, and the individual dates the employee
used hours, including the number of hours used.

The number of hours accrued, and the time period between accrual posting
records, is based on an employee's assigned Accrual Type and respective
Accrual Calculations.

Report Example:

Notes/Usage:

The Accrual Posting Report has been redesigned as of InfiniTime 7.08.
The Accrual Posting Report now displays all accrual posting records, or
specific instances where an employee either earns or uses Accrued Hours,
during the selected date range.

Notes/Usage:

This report will show all the exceptions for the employee in the specified
time, if you want to limit what exceptions to show you will need to select
the desired exceptions and also in the options set it to only display
selected exceptions. for example we just want to see the missed punches
for a period  you would tag missed punch on the selection criteria
and the option to limit to selected exceptions set it to yes and this
is the result.

### Employee Without Reviewed Timecards

Displays a list of employees with one or more Unreviewed Timecard Record
records during the Selected Date Range.

Report
Example:

![](/img/ImportReports_05.gif)

Notes/Usage:

- Depending on how report options are configured, the Unreviewed
  Timecard Report has the ability to display employees who:

* Have one or more timecard records during the date range which
  have not been reviewed by their supervisor
* Have one or more timecard records during the date range which
  have not been reviewed by the employee
* Have one or more timecard records during the date range which
  have not been reviewed by at least X different users

- It is important to note that any changes to a timecard record after
  it is marked 'Reviewed' will remove the 'Reviewed' Status. This is
  by design.
- In order to view all employees that have not yet been reviewed
  by the employee's supervisor within the specified period, run this
  report with the default selection criteria and alter only the date
  range.
- In order to view all employees that have one or more unreviewed
  timecard records, with no specific requirement as to who performed
  the review, run this report for the desired date range and default
  selection criteria with the following options:

* Alert When Number of Reviews are Less Than 1
* Alert When Timecards are Not Reviewed by Supervisor = No

Options:

### Failed Biometric Verification

Displays a list of employees who have failed biometric verification
within the date range specified by Selection Criteria.

Notes/Usage:

Abrupt changes in hand geometry can lead to biometric verification failure.
This may occur when excessively long fingernails are cut or if excessively
long fake nails are applied. It may be necessary to re-enroll an employee
within the Hand Reader under these circumstances. Otherwise, if employees
are having trouble with hand verification try raising the Reject Level,
which will reduce hand reader sensitivity. Refer to the Scout Reader Configuration
section of this document for more information.  Also you can check
if in fact the employee tried to punch in or they are just trying to beat
the system and say that the reader did not scan their hand or finger depending
of the biometric solution you have.

### Scheduled Overtime Early Warning

The Scheduled Overtime Early Warning Report is intended for use over
a given work week to anticipate employee overtime hours based on the number
of hours already worked for an employee throughout the week and the remaining
number of scheduled hours. The Scheduled Overtime Early Warning Report
is especially useful for environments with dynamic schedules and cross
trained employees. In this way, if it is observed an individual would
earn overtime hours with their existing schedule, the employee's schedule
may be altered and another employee can be called in to fill the gap.

Report Example:

Notes / Usage:

- This report is especially useful for organizations with Dynamic
  Scheduling (IE: Staffing Requirements increase due to workload / Customer
  Demand) and can be used to manage / reduce unnecessary overtime.
- The Scheduled Overtime Early Warning Report is most useful when
  executed toward the end of the week, such as on Wednesday and Thursday.
- In this way, supervisors can identify employees who would earn
  overtime if they worked their remaining scheduled hours.
- The Scheduled Overtime Early Warning Report answers four important
  questions for personnel managers:

* a. How many hours does the employee have for the work week
  already?
* b. How many hours is the employee scheduled for in the rest
  of the work week?
* c. How many hours would the employee have for the work week
  if they worked their remaining scheduled hours? Would the employee
  exceed 40 hours?
* d. If so, when would the employee hit 40 hours?

Notes/Usage:

- The Timecard Note report is useful
  for displaying all timecard notes for a given date range when reviewing
  employee timecard records prior to payroll.
- Unlike Audit Trail Comments, Timecard
  Notes are not required for every altered punch. Timecard Notes are
  only inserted by supervisors for comments of material importance.

Using the Attendance Review
Report

The Attendance Review
Report allows users to review employee attendance history for a given
period of time by displaying a character for each worked day, non-worked
day, and each day with Other Activity Hours such as Vacation, Sick, Personal,
or Jury Duty. Exceptions are also listed on the report to help managers
identify trends in employee behavior, such as regularly leaving work early
on a Friday or requesting every Third Wednesday of the Month off for various
reasons. Report options and Report Selection Criteria Settings can be
used to force the report to show only Other Activity Hours, Specific Other
Activity Types, and / or Specific Exceptions.

As shown in the image
above, the attendance review report displays a grid including all days
for the selected date range. For each day, a single character is printed
to indicate whether the day was a Work Day, a Non-Worked Day, or a day
with Other Activity. Additionally, total hours for Worked Days and days
with Other Activity are also displayed in the Month / Days Grid. If the
employee worked on a given date, the Worked Day Character will be displayed.
If the employee had other Activity Hours on a given date, the Other Activity
Attendance Review Character will be displayed according to the report
options.

TECHNICAL NOTE: The Month / Days Grid is only filled
for dates that fall within the date range. For this reason, to avoid confusion,
the Attendance Review Report should be executed for a date range that
includes all dates within a given month or multiple months. IE: 5/1/2013
to 6/30/2013 or 5/1/2013 to 5/31/2013.

In order for Other Activity
Hours to display on the Attendance Review Report, the Attendance Review
Character must be defined for the other activity type and the other activity
type must be included in the Selection Criteria on the report. The Attendance
Review Character can be configured on the Other Activity Update Form as
shown below.

1. Login
   to the Manager Module
2. Click
   on Lookups - Calculations Setup - Other Activity Types
3. Select
   the Other Activity Type you wish to configure for display on the Attendance
   Review Report and click Change
4. Enter
   the character(s) to be displayed on the Attendance Review Report for
   the respective Other Activity Type into the Attendance Review Report
   Character Field as shown.

5. Click OK to
   Save the Changes and repeat for all Other Activity Types to be displayed
   on the Attendance Review Report.

Technical Note: The
Date Fields on the Attendance Review Report supports display of only one
Hours Type. With this in mind, the Worked Day Character will be displayed
on any day with working hours, even if there were also Other Activity
Hours on the day. If multiple Other Activity Types occur on a single day
with no working hours, the Day Field will display the Other Activity Type
Character for the Other Activity Type with the most Hours. If all Other
Activity Types on a single day have the same number of hours, the first
Other Activity Type that was entered in the system will be displayed on
the report.

### Company Performance Analysis

Displays a Chart comparing scheduled hours against working hours and
absent hours for employees included in the Report Selection Criteria.
If the Selection Criteria is not altered, the report will calculate total
Scheduled Hours, Working Hours, and Absent Hours for the company as a
whole. Additionally, total Tardy, Long Break, and Early Departure minutes
are calculated and totaled on the report. In order for Tardy, Long Break,
and / or Early Departure minutes to be calculated the respective exceptions
must be configured.

Report Example:

![](/img/Employee_List_With_Supervisors.gif)

Notes/Usage:

- The Company Performance Analysis Report calculates total durations
  for the following hour types and exceptions:

* Worked Hours (Regular, Paid Break, OT1, OT2, OT3, OT4)
* Scheduled Hours (Scheduled Working Hours, Scheduled Paid
  Break Hours)
* Absent Hours
* Tardy Minutes
* Long Break Minutes
* Early Departure Minutes

- The Company Performance Analysis Report requires that employee
  schedules and respective exceptions such as Absent, Tardy, Long Break,
  and Early Departure be configured in order to total durations for
  each hours type.

  with more detail on an employee by employee basis, and is generally
  favored by customers.

for each department. Also lists the total amount of tardy exceptions,
long break exceptions, and early departures during the period specified
by Selection Criteria.

Report Example:

### Postable Schedule

Displays a chart showing detailed schedules for the employees and date
range specified by Selection Criteria. This report can be sorted by employee
or by department in order to provide a schedule that can be posted in
a conspicuous area for viewing by all employees within a specific department
or distributed to each employee as appropriate.

Report
Example:

![](/img/Labor_Cost_Payroll_Summary.gif)

Notes/Usage:

- Intended to be printed for individual work weeks.
- If the report is executed for a date range that includes more
  than one week, the report will print once for all employees included
  in the Selection Criteria for the First Week, and then once again
  for the second week.
- Ideal for organizations with dynamic scheduling needs where
  employee schedules vary on a regular basis.
- Ideal for posting in an accessible area to show employees exactly
  what Department / Job / Task they are assigned to for a given working
  period.

  Options.
- Daily Totals for each employee and Department / Job / Task Combination
  are displayed.
- It is recommended that the report be executed with specific Departments,
  specific Jobs, or specific Tasks tagged.
- When used for analyzing Department Schedules and Hours, the Department
  Grouping Type should be set to Activity and the Job / Task Grouping
  Types should be set to None.
- Similarly, when used for analyzing Job Schedules and Hours, Job
  Grouping Type should be set to Activity and the Department / Task
  Grouping Types should be set to None.

### Holiday Types Configuration - Process Flow

Follow the steps below to
gather required information and configure holidays:

1. Identify employee groups and / or individuals
   eligible for different holidays.
2. Identify any groups and / or individuals
   requiring special consideration. Each group of employees eligible
   for different Holiday Dates and / or special considerations will require
   a different holiday schedule type.\*\*
3. List all holidays for which each group
   and is eligible.
4. List any employee specific holidays (If
   Applicable.)
5. Create a Holiday Schedule Type for each
   group of employees identified in Step 2.
6. Insert Holiday Dates as appropriate for
   each Holiday Schedule Type. Be sure to set the Holiday Features and
   Conditions appropriately for each Holiday Date.

\*\*NOTE: If only a handful of employees are eligible
for specific holidays, as often occurs in the case of some Religious Holidays,
Holiday Dates may be configured on an Employee by Employee Basis within
the Employee's Profile.

Note: Holidays dates do not automatically move
from year to year. Holiday dates records must be created for each individual
holiday date on a yearly basis. Holiday records for prior years should
not be deleted.

Note: Employee holiday eligibility does not commonly
change based upon the amount of time an individual has been with a company,
however classes and tenures can be used to provide support for this scenario.

Note: InfiniTime
permits multiple Holiday Date Entries for a single Calendar Date.
This makes it possible to configure different Hours Mapping settings for
Worked Hours on a Holiday Date (IE: A Holiday Date with All Worked Hours
are Holiday Hours = Yes) and Holiday Pay Hours awarded even when the employee
does not report to work (IE: A Holiday Date with All Worked Hours are
Holiday Hours = No).

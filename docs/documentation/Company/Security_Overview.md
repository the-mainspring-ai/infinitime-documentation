# Security

## Security Overview

The InfiniTime Time and
Attendance Web Application includes a complete security suite with features
beyond conventional login and password requirements in order to provide
increased protection for sensitive employee information. Features such
as Human Verification, Password Expiration, and increased password manageability,
have been included in the InfiniTime
Software Application in order to deter unauthorized access and safeguard
sensitive information. In addition to these general security features,
InfiniTime includes a role
based security system which permits Software Administrators to control
access to both specific sections of the InfiniTime
Software as well as individual buttons and fields available on screen
for the respective window or form. A complete list of general security
features offered by the InfiniTime
Security Suite is provided below.

Security Feature Overview:

- Display of a CAPTCHA on the Login
  Form to prevent unauthorized access by Scripts and / or Programmatic
  Tools (Human Verification)
- Ability to expire user passwords on a cyclical basis every
  X Days as configured by the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator
- Ability for users to change their password upon login at their
  discretion
- Ability to automatically expire logged in users due to inactivity
  after X minutes as configured by the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator
- Ability to define an unlimited number of Security Roles, each
  with unique settings that control the exact sections of the InfiniTime Software as well as
  the individual fields and buttons on each respective window that
  can be accessed by users assigned to the respective security role.

* Stated Simply: Security Roles dictate what forms, fields,
  and buttons a user can access.

- Ability to configure Security Filters on a per user basis which
  control the individual employees which the user can view information
  for.

* Stated Simply: Security Filters dictate what users an individual
  can view and / or edit information for using the given forms,
  fields, and buttons their Security Role permits access to.

- Ability to configure Required Fields within the InfiniTime Software such that
  certain Human Resource or other related details must be entered
  for all employees. This feature permits the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator to further tailor how users enter information
  for specific sections of the InfiniTime
  Software.
- Ability to configure Default Values on an individual field
  by field basis such that when new records are inserted fields
  are automatically filled with the default value. This feature
  permits the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator to further tailor how users enter information
  for specific sections of the InfiniTime
  Software. Additionally this feature can reduce the amount of information
  that must be entered by the user and reduce user error upon data
  entry.
- Ability to configure Valid IP Addresses
  to permit access from only specific workstations or remote sites
  on either the Local Area Network or Wide Area Network.

* Valid IP Addresses can be configured
  on a Company Wide or Employee Specific basis.

- Ability to Control Which Reports (If Any) can be accessed from
  the Employee Module
- Optional PGP Encryption for Output
  Files Generated by the InfiniTime
  Software
- User Customizable Software
  Interface via InfiniTime
  Escort

* InfiniTime
  Escort permits the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator to design customized portals to the
  InfiniTime
  Application using a drag and drop interface. Images, Web Links,
  Clip Art, Text Labels, Reports, and buttons to access individual
  sections of the InfiniTime
  Software can be added to User designed Escort Windows.
* InfiniTime
  Escort provides the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator to:

- Create a customized software interface for specific
  work flows.
- Create a customized software interface for specific
  user groups.
- Limit exposure to the InfiniTime
  User Interface for non-technical users and / or individuals
  with minimal computing skills through use of a customized
  software interface.

## General Security Features

InfiniTime includes several
general security features as outlined below. Each of which are optional
and can be enabled at the discretion of the InfiniTime
Software Administrator.

### InfiniTime Human Verification (CAPTCHA)

A CAPTCHA is integrated into the InfiniTime
Login Window in order to secure against unauthorized access by automated
scripts. A CAPTCHA can be defined as a software program which generates
tests that cannot be passed by current computers but can be passed by
humans. During the login process, enter your Login ID and Password as
usual. Then enter the characters displayed in the CAPTCHA image into the
Validation Code field. Ignore any lines or dots on the image. Once all
information has been entered click OK to access the InfiniTime
Software.

![](/img/CH2_PGP1.gif)

### Password Expiration

InfiniTime automatically
tracks the time since an employee was inserted or since they last changed
their password and prompts the user to change their password after a specified
amount of days have passed. Once an employee's password has expired they
will be prompted to change their current password, as shown below, upon
their next login attempt.

![](/img/PhunkeyTabOne1.png)

The Employee will be prompted for their current and desired password.
A CAPTCHA will also be displayed at the bottom of the screen to prevent
automated scripts from abusing the change password feature. Simply ignore
the random dots and lines in the image and enter the characters that are
displayed. Once all information has been entered click OK to change the
password and access the InfiniTime
Software.

### Ability to Change Passwords Upon Login

InfiniTime provides the
ability for employees to change their own passwords as desired in order
to increase security. This is accomplished by using the Change Password
button which is available on the login screen for all modules. Through
the use of the change password button it is also possible to assign a
generic password during the initial configuration of employees, and then
allow each employee to set their own password as desired when they first
login.

To utilize the Change Password Button simply
open the Login Window for any InfiniTime
Software Module, enter your current login information, and click on the
Change Password Button as shown below.

![](/img/CH2_PGP38.gif)

A second screen will be displayed prompting
the user for their current password and the desired password. A CAPTCHA
will also be displayed at the bottom of the screen to prevent automated
scripts from abusing the change password feature. Simply ignore the random
dots and lines in the image and enter the characters that are displayed.
Once all information has been entered click OK to change your password
and access the InfiniTime
Software.

![](/img/image437.gif)

### Inactivity Time-out

Opening a new window, closing a window, or performing an action such
as inserting a punch. This feature helps secure management terminals in
a workplace that might be accessible to employees should the manager step
away for a short period. Once the predetermined period of time has elapsed
the user will be logged out of the software and will be unable to continue
working in the software until they login again. The message below will
be displayed if the user attempts to perform another action after the
session has been terminated.

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_001_Btn7_Reports.png)

To configure the Inactivity Time-out Setting click on the Company button
of the Manager Module's Toolbar as shown below.

![](/img/CH2_PGP26.gif)

Locate the Inactivity Time-out setting at the bottom of the form and
set the time-out period as desired.

![](/img/image436.gif)

## Security Roles

Security Roles make it possible to define the actions an employee may
perform after logging into the software. Security roles provide options
for configuring access to specific windows and individual buttons. This
makes it possible to completely lock employees out of sections of the
software or allow access and disable certain functions. The InfiniTime Software application includes
four default security roles: Administrator, Payroll Clerk, Supervisor,
and Employee. The Administrator role is suitable for administrative employees
only as it provides access to the entire software application. The Administrator
role cannot be edited, which makes it impossible to accidentally lock
an administrator out of the software when configuring security. The Payroll
Clerk Role begins with the same configuration as the Administrator role
with one exception. The Payroll Clerk Security Role can be edited to further
limit what may be accessed by the user. The Supervisor Role begins with
view only access to the entire software application and may be edited
to grant additional permissions to supervisors. The Employee Role begins
with highly limited software access and may be edited to grant additional
permissions to employees if desired. By default, even if a user assigned
to the Employee Security Role were to login to the Manager Module they
would be unable to access any information. Employees are able to access
the Employee Module and InfiniTime
Punch Modules.

### Accessing the Security Role Table

- Click on Lookups.
- Click on Employee Setup.
- Click on Security Roles.

![](/img/Timeout_Setting.jpg)

- The Security Role Table will be displayed.

![](/img/EmpSpecValidIPSUBNET.jpg)

![](/img/Sec025.png) Copies the Highlighted Security Role.
Security Configuration is also duplicated through a Class System which
designates the default security permissions associated with a security
role. Refer to Security Role Classes below for more information on the
Class System.

![](/img/secr6.gif) Opens the Security Role Update Form,
permitting the user to add a new security role.

![](/img/CH2_PGP12.gif)Opens the Security Role Update Form for the selected
Security Role, permitting the user to adjust Security Settings for the
selected Security Role. This option is only available for the Employee,
Payroll Clerk, Supervisor, and User Created Security Roles.

Security
Role Update Form

The Security Role Update
Form is used to insert a new Security Role or edit existing security roles.

![](/img/CH2_PGP29.gif)

Role

- Enter a Short Description of the Security Role Here. Generally, Employee
  Positions are used as the description for Security Roles.

Class

- Select the default behavior of the security role.

Allowed
to Reconfigure Grid - If this option is checked, all employees
assigned the to the security role will have the ability to edit Grid Configuration
and related options throughout the  InfiniTime
application. This option is checked by default for the Administrator and
Payroll Clerk Roles.

Allowed
to Reconfigure Security - If this option is checked, all employees
assigned the to the security role will have the ability to edit Security
Configuration and related options throughout the  InfiniTime application. This option
is checked by default for the Administrator and Payroll Clerk Roles.

Allowed
to Be A Supervisor in Readers - If this option is checked, all
employees assigned to the security role will have the ability to enroll
employees within Hardware Time and Attendance Terminals such as the Scout.
This option is checked by default for the Administrator and Payroll Clerk
Roles.

![](/img/Sec002.png) Returns all security configuration settings
for the highlighted security role to the default settings as described
in this document.

Security Roles have three innate properties, Grid Reconfiguration Rights,
Security Editing Rights, and Supervisor in Readers . By default, Rights
to Reconfigure the Grid and Edit Security are only granted to the Administrator
Security Role. Supervisor in Readers is granted to all roles except for
employees. Grid Reconfiguration Rights provide employees with the ability
to configure the grid, while Security Editing rights permit employees
to edit security roles and grid security.

Four security roles are configured by default and cannot be deleted.
Details for these security roles and their default settings can be found
below.

Administrator: The administrator
security role includes complete privileges to the software. Employees
assigned to this role can edit software security and configure the grid.
Employees assigned to the administrator security role have complete access
to the InfiniTime software.
The administrator security role cannot be edited.

Payroll Clerk: The payroll clerk
security role includes complete privileges to the software. By default,
employees assigned to this role have complete access to the InfiniTime software. Unlike the employeeâs
assigned to the administrator role, those assigned to the Payroll Clerk
security role do not have the ability to edit software security or configure
the grid. Security permissions granted by the payroll clerk security role
can also be edited to suit the users needs.

Supervisor: The supervisor security
role is intended for employee managers. Employeeâs assigned to the supervisor
role have the ability to view all information within InfiniTime
though, by default, they are unable to alter information within the software.
Supervisors are unable to edit software security or configure the grid.

Employee: The employee security
role is intended for employees. Employees assigned to this role have minimal
software access from within the Manager Module and are only able to view
their own information via the Employee Module. Employees are unable to
edit software security or configure the grid.

Security
Role Classes

![](/img/Sec021.png)

Security Roles are assigned classes in
order to designate default settings for the security role. Before the
implementation of a class system for Security Roles it was often difficult
for the user to establish what general security access level (IE: Administrator,
Employee, Payroll Clerk, or Supervisor) was associated with a user created
Security Role. By default a security role with the Employee class has
the same permissions as the Employee Role for all windows in the software.
The security role can then be edited using Security Keys throughout the
InfiniTime application
as desired in order to grant access to other items within the software.
The same logic can be applied to a security role with the Payroll Clerk
Class. Since the Payroll Clerk Class is assigned to it, the security role
will have the same permissions as the Payroll Clerk security role by default.
The security role can then be edited using Security Keys throughout the
InfiniTime application
in order to restrict access to certain parts of the software.

## Security Keys ( )

Security Keys are present on each window throughout the InfiniTime Application and provide
the InfiniTime Administrator
with the ability to view and edit security configuration for the respective
window. It is important to note that the presentation and display of Security
related settings are displayed slightly differently depending upon the
type of window the user is accessing. InfiniTime
includes three different types of windows as outlined below.

### Security Configuration By Window Type

- Table
  Browse Windows - Table Browse Windows include all windows within
  InfiniTime that list
  multiple items in a table or grid format. Generally, each section
  of the InfiniTime Software
  includes one or more Table Browse Windows. For example, the Employee
  Table, Department Table, and Policy Table are all examples of Table
  Browse Windows. Security Options for a specific Table Browse include
  only a single option - 'Allow Access'. If the 'Allow Access' option
  is checked for a given security role then all users assigned to the
  respective role will be able to access the respective Table Browse
  Window. If the 'Allow Access' option is unchecked for a given security
  role then all users assigned to the respective role will be denied
  access to the respective Table Browse Window. Only one Security option
  exists for Table Browse Windows
- Update
  Form Windows - Update Form Windows include all windows within
  InfiniTime that are
  called using the Insert or Change Buttons from a given Table Browse
  Window. For example, the Employee Update Form, Department Update Form,
  and Policy Update form are all examples of Update Form Windows. Update
  Form Windows include multiple tabs - Security, Default, and Required.
  Though some exceptions exist, each tab generally includes a single
  option for every field present on the Update Form as well as a single
  option for every right click menu item present on the respective window
  (if applicable). The Security Tab allows the InfiniTime
  Administrator to set the field to Normal, Hidden, or Disabled for
  each field as explained below. The Default Tab permits the InfiniTime Administrator to set Default
  Field Values while the Required Tab permits the InfiniTime
  Administrator to set
- Procedure
  Security - Procedures include all buttons such as Insert, Change,
  View, and Delete in addition to feature specific buttons from the
  respective Grid as displayed on individual Table Browse Windows such
  as 'Audit Trail' or 'Quick Punch'. Procedure security is accessed
  using the Grid Security Key ( ![](/img/Sec003.png) ) which is present
  on every window with a grid. The Procedure Security Table permits
  the InfiniTime Administrator
  to enable and / or disable access to specific buttons on a window
  by window basis.

### Viewing and Editing Security Configuration for a Specific Window

- Open the window you wish to alter security role rights for. This
  document will use the Employee Table as an example.

![](/img/secf1.gif)

- Click on the Security Configuration Icon ![](/img/CH2_PGP40.gif).
  The Security Configuration Icon, or Security Key, is generally displayed
  at the bottom of the window.

![](/img/Ch2_ValidIP_EmployeeSelect.jpg)

- The Procedure Security Table will
  be displayed. Security Options for a specific window, browse, and
  / or table such as the Employee Table, Department Table, Policy Table
  etc. include only a single option - 'Allow Access' for each security
  role. If the 'Allow Access' option is checked for a given security
  role then all users assigned to the respective role will be able to
  access the respective Table Browse Window. If the 'Allow Access' option
  is unchecked for a given security role then all users assigned to
  the respective role will be denied access to the respective Table
  Browse Window. Notice how the Employee Security Role is denied access
  to the Employee Table.

![](/img/ValidIP_BlockedRemSites.jpg)

- Should a user assigned to the Employee Security Role attempt to
  access a part of the software that they are not authorized to view
  the following screen will be displayed.

![](/img/CH2_PGP13.gif)

### Viewing and Editing Security Configuration for a Specific Update Form

- To view and / or edit Security Role Configuration for a specific
  Update Form, first open the Update Form you wish to alter security
  rights for. This document will use the Employee Update Form as an
  example.

![](/img/CH2_PGP3.gif)

- Click on the Security Configuration Icon ![](/img/Sec003.png).
  The Security Configuration Icon, or Security Key, is generally displayed
  at the bottom of the window.

![](/img/Sec019.png)

- The Form Security Table will be displayed. The Form security table
  includes one option for every field and right click menu item on the
  respective window. In order to make it easy to distinguish between
  fields and Right Click Menu Items, right click menu items have a prefix
  of 'Pop Up' before the field name. Notice that the Form Security Table
  includes multiple tabs: Security, Default, and Required.

Security: Allows
the InfiniTime Administrator
to control the state of individual fields on the form. A Field can be
in a Normal, Hidden, or Disabled State. Fields set to the Normal state
are displayed on the form and
can be edited for the respective security role. Fields set to the Hidden
state are not displayed on the form and cannot be viewed or edited for
the respective security role. Fields set to the Disabled State will be
displayed on the form but will not be editable for the respective security
role.

Default: Permits
InfiniTime Administrators
to set Default Field Values. Default Field Values affect all security
roles. [Additional
details can be found below in the Default Values](Security_Overview.md#sec21_Default_Values)
section of this document.

Required: Permits
the InfiniTime Administrator
to alter the fields which must be entered by the user when creating a
new record. Required Field values
affect all security roles.

2. ![](/img/LoginCaptcha.jpg)

- Notice that the Form Security Table has a drop down box on the
  top of the form listing all available Security Roles. To view or alter
  security settings for a specific role, first select the role from
  the Drop Down then adjust the individual field settings as appropriate.
- Click Close once all desired settings have been configured.

### Viewing and Editing Security Configuration for a Specific Procedure

- To view and / or edit Security Role Configuration for a specific
  Grid, first open the window you wish to alter security rights for.
  This document will use the Employee Table as an example.

![](/img/Sec008.png)

- Click on the Grid Configuration Security Key.

![](/img/secr4.gif)

- The Grid Security Table will be displayed. The procedure
  security table includes one option for each button available on the
  respective window. For example, the Employee Table includes
  five different buttons as shown below.

![](/img/image440.gif)

- Notice that the Grid Security Table has a drop down box on the
  top of the form listing all available Security Roles. To view or alter
  security settings for a specific role, first select the role from
  the Drop Down then adjust the individual field settings as appropriate.
- Click Close once all desired settings have been configured.

### Returning Security Configuration Settings to System Defaults for a specific window

Default security settings are saved within the InfiniTime
database for each window where security can be configured. To return security
configuration to the default settings:

- Open the window you wish to alter security role rights for. This
  document will use the Employee Table as an example.

![](/img/Sec002.png)

- Click on the Security Configuration Icon ![](/img/Sec012.png)

![](/img/Sec022.png)

3. Click the Default Button to reset window security settings for the
   selected security role.

![](/img/IT70ServerOnsiteOffSiteClients.JPG)

## Security Filters

Security Filters control an individualâs access to other employees within
the InfiniTime software.
Security Filters control the display of employees on each window within
the InfiniTime Software
where a list of employees is displayed, for example the Timecard Activity
Table, Employee Table, Schedule GANNT Chart, and the Report Selection
Criteria Settings are subject to Security Filters. In this way, a given
user is only permitted access to employees who are included in their security
filter.

Stated simply:

- Security Roles dictate what forms, fields, and buttons a user can
  access.
- Security Filters dictate what users an individual can view and
  / or edit information for using the given forms, fields, and buttons
  their Security Role permits access to.

Accessing
Security Filters

- Open the Employee Table.

![](/img/InactivityTimeoutPopup.jpg)

- Open the record that corresponds
  to the employee you wish to configure.

![](/img/CH2_PGP22.gif)

- Click on the Login Tab.

- Click on the Security Filter button.

![](/img/secr3.gif)

Configuring
Security Filters

The Security Filter Update form will open.
Security filters can be configured by employee, department, groups, or
range selections such as employee id and pay type. Employees will only
be able to access the employees specified within their security filter
settings. All employees are accessible by default.

Selected
Employees â Change the mode to Selected in order to select individual
employees that can be accessed. This is often used to select only the
individual, limiting employee access to only his or her own information.
Security roles and grid configuration can then be configured in order
to restrict the employeeâs access to the point that they can only view
their information without changing it.

Selected
Departments â Change the mode to selected in order to select individual
departments that the employee has access to. This grants the ability to
access information for all employees within the department. Departments
are one of the most common methods for configuring employee security filters.

Selected
Groups â Change the mode to selected in order to select individual
groups that the employee has access to. This provides the employee with
the ability to access information for all employees with the specified
group(s). Groups are one of the most common methods for configuring Employee
Security Filters.

When utilizing groups for employee filtering
it is recommended that a group for 'Unassigned' employees be created for
each group level present in the software. All supervisors should have
the ability to view the 'Unassigned' Groups. In this way if a supervisor
should forget to assign a group when creating an employee the employee
will automatically be assigned to the unassigned group. All supervisors
will then be able to edit the employee record and assign the employee
to the correct group.

If unassigned groups are not used in
this fashion the employee would be assigned to the default group which
the supervisor inserting employee records may not have access to. If this
is the case the supervisor will be unable to edit the newly created employee
record until either their security filters are changed or the employee's
group is set appropriately.

Range
Selections - By default, Range Selection filters are disabled.
Additional filter options such as filtering by employee ID, Department
Number, Pay Method, or Pay Type are available on the Range Selections
tab. Range Selections are rarely used for Security Filter purposes.

Filtering by Employee ID:

- Enter the minimum employee ID in
  the left field.
- Enter the maximum employee ID in
  the right field.

All employees with ID numbers that fall
in the above range will be displayed in the corresponding window.

Filtering by Department Number:

- Enter the minimum employee ID in
  the left field.
- Enter the maximum employee ID in
  the right field.

All employees with department numbers that
fall in the above range will be displayed in the corresponding window.

Filtering by Pay Type:

Use the interactive selection buttons to
select pay type(s) that you wish to view. Only employees with the specified
pay type(s) will be displayed. Refer to the Employee Setup section for
more information about pay types.

Filtering by Pay Method:

Use the interactive selection buttons
to select pay method(s) that you wish to view. Only employees with the
specified pay method(s) will be displayed. Refer to the Employee Setup
section for more information about pay methods.

## Required Fields

As previously introduced, Required Fields permit the InfiniTime Administrator to alter
the fields which must be entered by the user when creating a new record. Required Fields are configured
on the required Tab of the Form Security Table which can be accessed from
the Security Key for most Update Form swithin the InfiniTime
Software. It is important to note that certain context sensitive forms
such as the Quick Punch Update Form called from the Quick Punch Button
in the Company Timecard Table do not permit the user to adjust Required
Fields. For these forms, the Required Tab will simply not be displayed
on the Form Security Table. Details on how to access and configure Required
Fields are outlined below.

### Essential Concepts:

- Required Field Settings effect all users and are not configured
  for individual security roles.
- Fields which are specifically required by the InfiniTime
  Application cannot be changed to an optional status.
- Required Field Settings are primarily intended for requiring entry
  of specific Human Resources Details on the Employee Profile.

### Configuring Required Fields

- To view and / or edit Security Role Configuration for a specific
  Update Form, first open the Update Form you wish to alter security
  rights for. This document will use the Employee Update Form as an
  example.

![](/img/Ch2_ValidIP_UpdateForm.jpg)

- Click on the Security Configuration Icon ![](/img/Sec021.png).
  The Security Configuration Icon, or Security Key, is generally displayed
  at the bottom of the window.

![](/img/SecFilter02.gif)

- The Form Security Table will be displayed. Click on
  the Required Tab.

![](/img/PhunkeyTabOne1.png)

- All fields on the respective Update Form will be displayed.
  Notice that fields specifically required by the InfiniTime
  Application have a required status of 'True' and cannot be changed.

##

- Use the Drop Down options to change Required Field settings
  as desired, then click the Close Button to save your changes.
- Fields set to a required status of 'True' will now be considered
  required Fields by the InfiniTime
  User Interface. Required fields are shaded in blue. A warning will
  be displayed if the user attempts to save a record with a blank required
  field.

![](/img/CH2_PGP39.gif)

![](/img/CH2_PGP6.gif)

## Default Values

As previously introduced, Default Values permit the InfiniTime
Administrator to set Default Field Values. Default Values are configured
on the Default Tab of the Form Security Table which can be accessed from
the Security Key for most Update Forms within the InfiniTime
Software. It is important to note that certain context sensitive forms
such as the Quick Punch Update Form called from the Quick Punch Button
in the Company Timecard Table do not permit the user to adjust Default
Values. For these forms, the Default Tab will simply not be displayed
on the Form Security Table. Details on how to access and configure Default
Values are outlined below.

### Essential Concepts:

- Default Value Settings effect all users and are not configured
  for individual security roles.
- It is important to keep the field type in mind when setting Default
  Values. For example, do not attempt to enter an Alphanumeric Value
  into a numeric field.
- Default Value Settings are primarily intended for situations where
  a specific setting is set to a single value for the majority of records,
  or to provide suggested values for user entry. For example, one common
  use of Default Values is to set the Time Off Request and Schedule
  Change Request From Time and To Time to an appropriate value for your
  organization such as 6:00 AM - 11:00 PM.

### Configuring Default Values

- To view and / or edit Security Role Configuration for a specific
  Update Form, first open the Update Form you wish to alter security
  rights for. This document will use the Request Message Database Update
  Form as an example.

![](/img/CH2_PGP7.gif)

- Click on the Security Configuration Icon ![](/img/EmpSpecValidIP_OnsiteOffsite.jpg).
  The Security Configuration Icon, or Security Key, is generally displayed
  at the bottom of the window.

![](/img/CH2_PGP30.gif)

- The Form Security Table will be displayed. Click on
  the Default Tab.

![](/img/CH2_PGP2.gif)

- All available fields on the respective Update Form will be displayed.

![](/img/CH2_PGP13.gif)

- Use the provided controls to change Required Field settings
  as desired, then click the Close Button to save your changes.

![](/img/CH2_PGP28.gif)

- Default values will be automatically entered upon subsequent
  attempts to enter a record using the respective form. In this case,
  when users perform a Time Off Request the From Time and To Time will
  be automatically filled with the default values as shown.

![](/img/secr3.gif)

## Valid IP Addresses - Overview

Access to the InfiniTime
Software Application can be limited by defining Valid IP Addresses. If
Valid IP Addresses are defined InfiniTime
will compare the IP Address of the user to the list of valid IP Addreses
within InfiniTime. If the
user's IP Address appears on the list, they will be granted access to
the software after a successful login. Should the user's IP address be
absent from the list they will be denied access to the InfiniTime Software. It should be
noted that Valid IP Addresses can be specified for the entire company
and for each individual employee. This gives the Software Administrator
complete control over how the software is accessed from both the local
area network and remote sites.

It is important to distinguish between access granted to the software
through valid IP Addresses and Security Permissions which are defined
by Security Roles. Valid IP Addresses define an employees ability to log
into the software while security permissions define the actions an employee
can perform within the software after they are logged in. For example,
an Administrator has full control over all features and windows within
the InfiniTime Software,
even though an employee is assigned to the Administrator role within the
Software they will still be unable to log into the software if the IP
Address of their computer is not listed in either the Company or Employee
Valid IP Addresses Table.

The validation process that occurs when an employee attempts to login
to the InfiniTime Software
has been altered to accommodate the use of Valid IP Addresses.  When
an employee attempts to login to the InfiniTime
software several factors determine whether the employee will be granted
access. The procedure is outlined below.

1.) The Login ID and
Password entered by the employee must be correct.

2.) Entries in the Company
Wide Valid IP Address table are compared to the IP Address of the user's
computer.  If the IP Address of the employee's computer matches an
entry in the table, or if the Company Wide Valid IP Address table is blank
the logon process will continue. Otherwise the employee will be denied
access.

3.) The IP address of
the employee's computer is compared to any entries in the Employee Specific
Valid IP Address table. If the IP Address of the employee's computer matches
an entry in the table, or if the Employee Specific Valid IP Address table
is blank the login process will complete successfully and the software
will load. Otherwise the employee will be denied access to the software.

When Valid IP Addresses are utilized employees will be unable to log
into the software from any IP Address that is not listed in either the
Company Valid IP Address table or the Employee Valid IP Address table.
The only exception to this rule is when the Company Valid IP Address table
has no IP addresses defined and some or all employees have Employee Specific
Valid IP Addresses defined. In this situation access to the software will
only be denied for those employees with Valid IP Addresses Specified in
their employee record. All other employees can access the software from
any location.

#### Accessing the Valid IP Address Table for the Company

Valid IP Addresses are configured from within the Manager Module. To
Access the Valid IP Address table for the company you must be logged in
as an employee assigned to the Administrator Security role, or equivalent.

#### What is an IP Address?

An IP Address is a unique numeric identifier for a specific computer
or device, commonly referred to as a host, that is connected to the internet
or a local area network. An IP Address can be thought of as something
similar to a telephone number. They provide a way for other hosts or devices
to communicate with or contact you. An IP Address is considered either
public or private.

Private IP Addresses are only used internally within an office, home,
or enterprise network. They are not known on the internet and cannot be
used to communicate with other computers online. Private IP Addresses
are assigned by your network administrator or dynamically assigned by
a DHCP server. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) refers to a
set of rules used by a communication device to obtain Internet Addresses
from a server. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server keeps a
list of addresses available for assignment and assigns them to network
devices or hosts as needed.

Public IP Addresses are used to communicate on the internet and are
made known to other hosts or devices. Public IP Addresses are assigned
by your Internet Service Provider.

IP Addresses, both Public and Private, can be either static or dynamically
assigned. Every time you connect to the internet your ISP will assign
you a Public IP Address. If this Public IP Address is the same every time
you connect to the internet then it is a Static IP Address. The ISP has
reserved this address for your use only and will not lease it out to another
device or computer on the internet. In order for a computer or device
on the internet to be contacted on a regular basis by a remote device
it must have a Static IP Address.

Keeping the example of a phone number in mind, if you constantly changed
your phone number it would be impossible for others to contact you on
a regular basis using the same phone number. This is the case for Dynamic
IP Addresses. If your ISP Assigns you a different Public IP Address every
time you connect to the internet then your Public IP Address is Dynamic.
It is not possible to use Dynamic IP Addresses with the Valid IP Address
feature of InfiniTime.

Private IP Addresses can also be static or dynamic. Dynamic IP Addresses
are often used on local area networks in order to reduce the amount of
manual configuration that must be performed by the Network Administrator.
Dynamic IP Addresses are automatically assigned by a DHCP server on your
local area network. Static IP Addresses must be manually configured by
the Network Administrator or other Authorized Personnel with access to
your network equipment.

#### How do I locate and determine if the Private IP Address for a machine on my local area network is static?

It is possible to determine the IP Address
assigned to any computer on a Windows Operating system by using the dos
command IPCONFIG. The following steps will walk you through opening an
dos prompt, using the IPCONFIG command, and reading the command's output.
You must be at the machine to perform the steps outlined below. If you
are still unsure after following this process please contact your Network
Administrator for assistance.

- Click on Start.

![](/img/CH2_PGP39.gif)

- Click on Run.

![](/img/EmpSpecValidIPSUBNET.jpg)

- Type cmd into the dialog box.

![](/img/Timeout_CompBtn.jpg)

- Click OK.

- A dos window will open. Type ipconfig
  /all

![](/img/Sec025.png)

- Hit enter. The network configuration
  of your server will be displayed.

- The InfiniTime
  7.0 Server should have a static ip address. The results below indicate
  a static address of 192.168.1.40 with DHCP disabled.

![](/img/Ch2_PGP9.gif)

- The results below show DHCP enabled.
  This means the computer has a dynamic IP Address assigned. The computer
  must be configured with a static Private IP Address in order to grant
  or limit access to it using Valid IP Addresses.

![](/img/CH2_PGP17.gif)

#### How do I locate and determine if the Public IP Address for a machine on a remote network is static?

A variety of websites exist to assist internet users with identifying
their Public IP Address. One such website is http://www.whatismyip.com.
Simply browse to this website to identify your Public IP Address. The
simplest way to determine if your Public IP Address is static is to contact
your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

To determine your Public IP Address using www.whatismyip.com

Click on Start

![](/img/secr4.gif)

Click on Run

![](/img/Sec006.png)

Type www.whatismyip.com in the dialog box as shown.

![](/img/SecFilter01.gif)

Click OK.

The website will open and display your Public IP Address on the home
page.

#### Why would I want to configure Valid IP Addresses?

Valid IP Addresses make it possible to restrict access to the InfiniTime Software Application from
all computers, both local and remote, except those with an IP address
that is defined as valid or authorized. This helps secure confidential
employee information that may be contained within the InfiniTime
Database by adding an extra layer of security to the application. Users
must not only have valid login credentials but they must also be located
at a machine with an IP Address that has been designated as valid by the
InfiniTime Software Administrator.

Valid IP Addresses can also be used to restrict employee access to certain
sites. A corporation with multiple sites may only want their employees
to be able to clock in or out from work using the InfiniTime
Software when they are at the office. Valid IP Addresses can be assigned
to individual employees. Depending upon the configuration, this will allow
the employee to access the software only from their desk or from any computer
in the office. If the employee would attempt to access the software from
any other machine they would be denied access.

Before deciding to use the Valid IP Address feature of InfiniTime you must understand how
your software is deployed. Four deployment options are available for InfiniTime as outlined below.

Standalone InfiniTime
Server

![](/img/Sec014.png)

Standalone Installations require only a server. In a Standalone Installation
the server hosts all InfiniTime
files and information. The InfiniTime
software can be viewed using a web browser in the same way it would be
accessed on a Client machine. A stand-alone installation requires an Internet
connection during installation for registration purposes only. After installation
an Internet connection is not required for use of the software.

Valid IP Addresses can not be used to limit access in a standalone environment.
The InfiniTime Server can
not be restricted from accessing InfiniTime.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with On-Site Clients

![](/img/EmpSpecValidIP_BlockedRemSites.jpg)

As shown, this server is connected to a Local Area Network and hosts
the InfiniTime software
for Client machines that are on the local network. Employees and Managers
can access the software and all of its features from any computer on the
network.

In this scenario Valid IP Addresses can be used to limit access to specific
hosts on the local area network. This would be accomplished by retrieving
the IP Address from each computer for which access is to be granted. This
IP Address would then be configured in the Company or Employee Valid IP
Address table to grant the desired level of access.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with Off-Site Clients

![](/img/CH2_PGP32.gif)

As pictured, this server has a Static ip address and uses an Internet
service such as T1, DSL, or Cable to connect to the Internet. Any employee
or affiliate armed with the proper web site address and their login information
can log into the InfiniTime
software in order to run the InfiniTime
Labor Management Software. It is important to understand that there is
no client software required to access the InfiniTime
Application. Any computer connected to the internet with a web browser
can be used to access the InfiniTime
Software. Users must simply have valid login credentials and the proper
web site address to access the InfiniTime
Software on the server.

Valid IP Addresses make it possible to limit access to the InfiniTime server to specific remote
sites. This is accomplished by defining a remote computer's Public IP
Address as valid within the Company or Employee Valid IP Address Table
to grant the desired level of access.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with On-Site and Off-Site Clients

![](/img/CH2_PGP6.gif)

Combining the first two options provides a versatile deployment alternative
separating Web Applications from other software applications. Employees
on the local network and abroad have full access to all of InfiniTime's features. Remote users
need only a computer or laptop, an Internet connection, and their login
information to connect to the InfiniTime
software.

In this scenario Valid IP Addresses can be used to limit access to specific
machines on the local area network and specific remote sites.

#### What information should I have available before attempting to configure Valid IP Addresses?

The Following steps should be completed before attempting to configure
Valid IP Addresses:

- List all computers on the local network that will be granted access
  to the InfiniTime Software.
  If all computers on the local network will be granted access to the
  InfiniTime software
  a complete list is not required.
- List all remote sites that will be granted access to the InfiniTime Software. If all remote
  sites are to be granted access to the InfiniTime
  software a list is not required.
- Verify and record the IP Address for each computer on the local
  network listed in step 1. Each computer must have a static IP Address.
- Verify and record the Public IP Address for each remote site listed
  in step 2. Each site must have a static public IP Address. Note: All
  computers at the remote site will use the same Public IP Address.
  It is not possible to grant only specific remote machines access to
  the InfiniTime Software
  using Valid IP Addresses.

#### What is the difference between Company Wide Valid IP Addresses and Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses and why would I choose to use one over the other?

InfiniTime features two
methods of defining Valid IP Addresses in order to offer Software Administrators
complete control over how the InfiniTime
Software Application is accessed. Company Wide Valid IP Addresses are
IP Addresses from which any employee can login to the InfiniTime
Software. Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses are IP Addresses from which
a specific employee will be granted access. The following configurations
are available:

Company
Wide Valid IP Addresses Only

The use of only Company Wide Valid IP Addresses will grant all employees
access to the InfiniTime
Software from any IP Address defined as valid within the Company Wide
Valid IP Address table.

Employee
Specific Valid IP Addresses Only

The use of only Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses will grant access
to the InfiniTime Software
from any location for employees that do not have Valid IP Addresses defined.
Employees with Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses will only be able
to login from hosts with an IP address designated as valid in the Employee
Valid IP Address Table under their employee record.

Company
Wide and Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses

The use of both Company Wide and Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses
will grant access from the IP addresses defined by as valid by the Company
Wide TCP/IP Address Table for any individual without Employee Specific
Valid IP Addresses defined. Employees with Employee Specific Valid IP
Addresses will only be able to login from hosts with an IP address designated
as valid in the Employee Valid IP Address Table under their Employee Record.

It is important to note that the Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses
override Company Wide Valid IP Addresses. For example if Valid IP Addresses
were configured as shown below, Employee A would only be able to access
the InfiniTime 7.0software
from 10.1.1.64, even though 10.1.1.16, 10.1.1.32, and 10.1.1.48 are defined
as Company Wide Valid IP Addresses. By defining employee specific Valid
IP addresses you are instructing the software to grant access to that
employee from ONLY those addresses
specified in the Employee Specific Valid IP Address Table.

Company Wide Valid IP Addresses                                     Employee
A Valid IP Addresses

10.1.1.16                                                                                  10.1.1.64

10.1.1.32

10.1.1.48

#### What is the proper way to grant access to all computers or hosts on a given subnet or network address?

To grant access to all computers or hosts on a given subnet or network
address, first identify the common digits  of the IP address then
fill the remaining portion of the IP address with zeroes.

For example:

To grant access to all computers with the IP Addresses of 192.168.1.1
to 192.168.1.255 first identify the common portion of the IP address.

192.168.1.1

192.168.1.255

The common portion of the IP Address is the first three octets or 192.168.1.
Fill the remaining portion of the IP Address with zeroes. In this case,
the address to be added to the Company Valid IP Address Table would be
192.168.1.0

# Valid IP Configuration Examples

InfiniTime features two methods of
defining Valid IP Addresses in order to offer
Software Administrators complete control over how the InfiniTime
Software Application is accessed. Company Wide Valid IP
Addresses are IP Addresses from which any employee
can login to the InfiniTime
Software. Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses
are IP Addresses from which a specific employee
will be granted access. Examples showing possible uses of Valid IP Addresses are provided below for each InfiniTime Software Deployment Option. Refer to
the Valid IP Addresses Introduction & FAQ
for general information regarding the use and configuration of Valid IP Addresses.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with Onsite Clients

In an environment where the InfiniTime
Software is only used within the corporate or business network it is possible
to limit access to meet a variety of goals. Regardless of whether you
are looking to limit access to InfiniTime
to specific departments, specific employees, or specific locations throughout
the office the Valid IP Addresses feature is a powerful security tool
providing the InfiniTime
Software Administrator with complete control over how employees access
the InfiniTime Software.
Examples of commonly used scenarios where Valid IP Addresses can be applied
in an Onsite Environment are provided below.

Company
Wide Valid IP Addresses: Limiting Access to Specific Departments or Subnets

Valid IP Addresses can be used to limit software access to specific
Departments or Subnets. The example below
depicts an office building with two departments, Accounting and Phone
Support. Valid IP Addresses are used to grant access to the Accounting
Department and restrict access from all other computers on the network.
All of the computers in the Accounting Department have an IP Address beginning
with 192.168.10 while all of the computers in the Phone Support Department
have an IP Address beginning with 192.168.20. To permit access to the
InfiniTime software for
a group of computers the common octets of an IP Address must be identified.
To identify the common octets for a group of computers compile a list
of all computers as shown below. To determine the IP Address which must
be added to InfiniTime
in order to grant access to all computers within the group identify the
common octets and fill any remaining octets with zeroes. There is no limit
to the amount of Valid IP Addresses that can be added to the InfiniTime Software. Multiple IP Addresses
can be added to grant access to more than one group while excluding access
to others.

Computer Name               IP
Address

Accounting Desktop 1     192.168.10.10

Accounting Desktop 2     192.168.10.11

Accounting Desktop 3     192.168.10.12

Accounting Desktop 4     192.168.10.13

Common Octets:              192.168.10

Final IP Address:              192.168.10.0

![](/img/CH2_PGP40.gif)

Through the use of Company Valid IP Addresses all employees will be
granted access to the software from computers within the Accounting Department.
Any employee that attempts to access the InfiniTime
software on a computer outside of the Accounting department will be denied
access to the software in the above scenario.

Company
Wide Valid IP Addresses: Limiting Access to Specific IP Addresses or Computers

Valid IP Addresses can be used to limit software
access to specific IP Addresses or Computers. The example below depicts
an office building with two departments, Human Resources and Graphics.
Valid IP Addresses are used to grant access to the HR Supervisor and the
Graphics Supervisor. All other computers on the network will be denied
access to the InfiniTime
Software. There is no limit to the amount of Valid IP Addresses that can
be added to the InfiniTime
Software. Multiple IP Addresses can be added to grant access to as many
IP Addresses as desired. Keep in mind any IP Addresses not specifically
listed in the Company Wide Valid IP Address table will be denied access
to the InfiniTime Software.

![](/img/Ch2_ValidIP_UpdateForm.jpg)

Through the use of Company
Valid IP Addresses all employees will be granted access to the software
from computers with IP Addresses that are listed in the Company Valid
IP Address Table. In this example, this includes HR Desktop 1 and Graphics
Desktop 1 which are both used by the Department Supervisors. Any employee
that attempts to access the InfiniTime
software on other computers within the building will be unable to access
the software unless the IP Address of their computer is added to the Valid
IP Addresses Table.

Employee
Specific Valid IP Addresses: Limiting Employee Access to Specific IP Addresses

Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses can be
used to limit employee access on an individual bases to specific IP Addresses
or Computers. The example below depicts an office building with four desktop
machines. Valid IP Addresses are used to grant access to each employee
only at their own desktop. The Employee Specific Valid IP Address table,
which is found on the login tab of the employee's
record, is displayed under each employee's desktop. This shows the IP
Address that has been added to each employees record in order to restrict
their access to only their desktop. Keep in mind there is no limit to
the amount of Valid IP Addresses that can be added to the InfiniTime Software. Multiple IP Addresses
can be added to allow access for individual employees from additional
computers. It is important to note that employees will be denied access
from any IP Address not specifically listed in their Employee Specific
Valid IP Address table once a single IP Address is entered into the Employee
Specific Valid IP Address Table.

![](/img/CH2_PGP16.gif)

Through
the use of Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses employee access can be
limited to specific locations. In the example above the IP Address of
each employee's desktop has been added to their Valid IP Address table.
This causes the software to deny access if the employee would attempt
to log in to the software from any computer on the local network other
than their own desktop.

Employee
Specific Valid IP Addresses: Limiting Employee Access to Specific Departments
or Subnets

Valid IP Addresses can be used to limit software access to specific
Departments or Subnets. The example below
depicts an office building with two departments, Accounting and Phone
Support. Valid IP Addresses are used to grant access to the computers
within the Phone Support Department and restrict access from all other
computers on the network. All of the computers in the Phone Support Department
have an IP Address beginning with 192.168.20 while all of the computers
in the Accounting Department have an IP Address beginning with 192.168.10.
To permit access to the InfiniTime
software for a group of computers the common octets of an IP Address must
be identified. To identify the common octets for a group of computers
compile a list of all computers as shown below. To determine the IP Address
which must be added to InfiniTime
in order to grant access to all computers within the group identify the
common octets and fill any remaining octets with zeroes. There is no limit
to the amount of Valid IP Addresses that can be added to the InfiniTime Software. Multiple IP Addresses
can be added to grant access to more than one group while excluding access
to others. Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses are configured for employees
on an individual bases. With this in mind it is possible to configure
Valid IP Addresses for some employees while leaving the default settings
for other employees. As long as the Company Wide Valid IP Addresses are
not configured employees without Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses
will be able to access the software from anywhere.

Computer Name               IP
Address

Accounting Desktop 1     192.168.20.10

Accounting Desktop 2     192.168.20.11

Accounting Desktop 3     192.168.20.12

Accounting Desktop 4     192.168.20.13

Common Octets:              192.168.20

Final IP Address:              192.168.20.0

![](/img/CH2_PGP17.gif)

Through the use of Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses employees will
be granted access to the software from computers within the Phone Support
Department and denied access from other computers on the network as long
as their Valid IP Addresses are configured appropriately as shown.

Onsite
InfiniTime Server with
Offsite Clients

Limit
Access to Specific Remote Sites

Valid IP Addresses can
be used to limit software access to specific IP Addresses or Computers.
The example below depicts a company with multiple office buildings. Valid
IP Addresses are used to grant access to all computers at Building B.
Computers at all other remote sites will be denied access to the InfiniTime Software. There is no limit
to the amount of Valid IP Addresses that can be added to the InfiniTime Software. Multiple IP Addresses
can be added to grant access to as many remote sites as desired. Keep
in mind any IP Addresses not specifically listed in the Company Wide Valid
IP Address table will be denied access to the InfiniTime
Software.

![](/img/image436.gif)

Through the use of Company
Wide Valid IP Addresses all employees will be granted access to the software
from computers at any remote site whose Public IP Address is listed in
the Company Wide Public IP Address Table. Keep in mind the software will
not be accessible from any remote site whose Public IP Address is not
listed in the Company Wide Public IP Address Table. It is necessary to
be present at, or have the ability to connect to, a computer that has
a Valid IP Address in order to add or remove IP Addresses from the Company
Wide or Employee Specific Valid IP Address tables. In the example shown
the Public IP Address of computers at Building B has been added to the
Valid IP Address Table. This grants access to all employees on any computer
at Building B and denies access to any other remote computers.

Limit
Employee Access to Specific Remote Sites with Omnipresent Administrator
Access

Valid
IP Addresses can be used to limit software access to specific IP Addresses
or Computers. The example below depicts a company with multiple office
buildings. Valid IP Addresses are used to grant access to all computers
at Building B for specific employees only. Employees attempting to access
the software at all other remote sites will be denied access. It is important
to understand Employee Specific Valid IP Addresses are configured on an
individual employee basis. In order to provide omnipresent access for
employees with Administrative Rights the Employee Specific Valid IP Address
table must be blank for that employee. In the example below Bob Emery
is the Administrator. It should also be noted that the Company Wide Valid
IP Address Table must be blank in order for Administrators to have omnipresent
access to the software. Multiple IP Addresses can be added to grant access
to as many remote sites as desired. Keep in mind employees will be denied
access from all IP Addresses not listed in the Employee Specific Valid
IP Address Table.

![](/img/changepwform.jpg)

Through the use of Employee Specific Valid
IP Addresses each employees will be granted access to the software from
computers at any remote site whose Public IP Address is listed in the
Employee Specific Valid IP Address Table under their Employee Record.
 In the example shown the Public IP Address of computers at Building
B has been added to the Employee Specific Valid IP Address Table for each
employee. This grants access to each employee whose Valid IP Addresses
are configured for any computer at Building B and denies access to any
other remote computers. Additionally Administrators can access the software
from any location as long as the Company Wide Valid IP Address table is
blank.

Onsite
InfiniTime Server with
Onsite and Offsite Clients

Omnipresent
Access: Overview

Omnipresence refers
to the availability of the InfiniTime
Software from any location with an Internet Connection and compatible
web browser. This is accomplished by publishing the InfiniTime
Web Site to the Internet. Once this task is performed, by default, the
InfiniTime Software can
be accessed from any location with an internet connection as long as the
user has valid login credentials. Valid IP Addresses provide a valuable
security option by making it possible to limit access to the InfiniTime software. Once Valid IP
Addresses are configured, any local or remote user whose IP Address is
not defined in either the Company Wide or Employee Specific Valid IP Address
table will be denied access to the software. It is important to understand
how adding a single Valid IP Address to the Company Wide Valid IP Address
table effects software access. When an employee attempts to login to the
InfiniTime software several
factors determine whether or not the employee will be able to login. First
the Login ID and Password entered by the employee must be correct. Once
these are verified entries in the Company Wide Valid IP Address table
are compared to the IP Address of the computer the user is located at.
If the IP Address of the employee's computer matches an entry in the table,
or if the Company Wide Valid IP Address table is blank the logon process
will continue. Otherwise the employee will be denied access. Finally the
IP address of the employee's computer is compared to any entries in the
Employee Specific Valid IP Address table. If the IP Address of the employee's
computer matches an entry in the table, or if the Employee Specific Valid
IP Address table is blank the login process will complete successfully
and the software will load. Otherwise the employee will be denied access
to the software.

If omnipresence is desired
the Company Valid IP Address Table must be left blank. This will allow
users to access the software from any location, both local or remote,
as long as their Employee Valid IP address table is blank. If desired
access for specific employees can be limited to specific local or remote
locations using the Employee Valid IP Address table.

Limit
Employee Access to Specific Onsite Computers and Remote Sites with Omnipresent
Administrator Access

In order to allow omnipresent
access for Administrative Employees the Company Wide Valid IP Address
table must be left blank. In this scenario the Employee Valid IP Address
table will be used to limit access for all employees. It should be noted
that new employees added to the system after the initial configuration
of Valid IP Addresses will need to have the Employee Specific Valid IP
Addresses defined in their employee record or they will be able to access
the software from anywhere, including their homes computers. This is undesirable
in large environments where it may go unrecognized if employees punch
in or out after leaving the office from a remote computer.

The image below depicts
a company with multiple office buildings and remote employees. InfiniTime Software Administrators
and Payroll Clerks are allowed to access the software from any location
with an internet connection in order to edit employee activity, access
employee information, and run payroll. Onsite access is restricted to
employees in the Human Resources Department while remote access is restricted
to company buildings only to prevent employees from accessing the software
at home. Refer to the Omnipresent Access: Overview section of this document
for additional Information on Omnipresent Access.

![](/img/Sec018.png)

Through the use of Employee
Specific Valid IP Addresses employees with Valid IP Addresses configured
as those shown for Jeff Fischer will be granted access to the software
from both Building B, and building C. Those without Employee Specific
Valid IP Address configured, such as Eddie Clark and Fred Tabor,  will
be able to access the InfiniTime
Software from any location with an internet connection. Local IP Addresses
can also be added to the Employee Specific Valid IP Address Table to grant
access for onsite computers as shown for John Smith, who is granted access
to the InfiniTime Software.
Keep in mind it is possible to use common octets in order to permit access
from only specific departments or subnets on the local network. Refer
to the example entitled "Limiting Employee Access to Specific Departments
or Subnets" for more information on this technique.

## Controlling Access to Reports from the Employee Module

In some cases, it may not be desirable for employees to be able to execute
reports to view their timecard records, schedules, and / or accrual details
on demand from the Employee Module. InfiniTime
permits the InfiniTime
Administrator to assign different reports to the buttons on the Employee
Module Toolbar or disable the buttons entirely. Details are provided below.

### Employee Module Report Buttons - Overview

The Employee Module Toolbar includes three buttons which employees can
use to print reports. By default, these buttons are configured as follows:

Print Timecard - Prints the
Timecard Detail Report for the respective employee. The Employee may select
the date range.

Print Schedule - Prints the
Postable Schedule Report for the respective employee. The Employee may
select the date range.

Print Accruals - Prints the
Employee Accruals Report for the respective employee which displays the
employee's Accrual Totals.

![](/img/Ch2_ValidIP_EmpSpecIPTable.jpg)

### Disabling Access to Reports from the Employee Module

To completely disable access to Reports from the Employee Module, simply
uncheck the 'Print from Employee Module...' option for the Timecard Detail

## Optional PGP Encryption for Output Files

In order to provide maximum security for sensitive information such
as employee demographics and banking information, an encryption algorithm
has been integrated into the InfiniTime
Software. PGP includes an extensive suite of encryption tools featuring
a combination of public key and conventional cryptography providing improved
security without a decrease in performance or usability. PGP can be used
across unsecure networks to secure data from access by unauthorized users.
With the integration of PGP all files entering and exiting the InfiniTime environment can be encrypted
to safeguard sensitive information. Details on the configuration and use
of PGP for all of the supported file types can be found below.

Technical Note: This document assumes the user
has previous experience with the PGP Encryption Algorithm and has a PGP
Client Available. Instructions are provided for using Keys, both public
and private, provided by the user. A basic knowledge of the use and configuration
of the user's PGP Client are assumed. InfiniTime
supports the full feature set of the PGP Encryption algorithm through
the use of Public Keys, Private Keys, and Passphrases. It should be noted
that not all PGP Clients require all three levels of security. It is the
users responsibility to configure PGP for use with their individual PGP
Client. Inception Technologies does endorse or support the use and configuration
of any specific PGP Client application.

## PGP Encryption - Payroll Export Files

The configuration and use of PGP varies according to the output method
used. Three output methods are available for use with the InfiniTime Application. Payroll Export
files can be emailed, exported and retrieved from the InfiniTime
FTP Output, or sent via FTP to a remote FTP site. Examples for the configuration
and use of PGP are arranged below according to the Output format used.

InfiniTime FTP Output - PGP Configuration

When it is not desirable to send a Payroll File via Email or FTP the
file can be made available for download from the InfiniTime
Output FTP site in a secure format. It should be noted that anyone with
internet access who knows the web address used to access the FTP site
can access it if InfiniTime
has been published to the internet. This could permit unauthorized users
to access payroll export files. Users should retrieve encrypted files
immediately from the InfiniTime
Output FTP Site and delete them from the public FTP site afterwards.

# PGP Encryption - Changing PGP Key Files

The first step to properly configuring InfiniTime
for use with your PGP Client Software is to understand the basics of cryptography
and the configuration of your PGP Client Software. Be sure to read any
documentation supplied with your PGP Client software.  PGP Desktop,
a common PGP client designed and made available by the creator of PGP
is available from [www.pgp.com](http://www.pgp.com) as a 30
day trial for free. This PGP client includes complete documentation detailing
the basics of cryptography and a quick start guide for the use of PGP
Desktop. While these documents are useful as general knowledge regarding
the use and configuration of PGP, more so if you are using PGP Desktop
as your client, they may not be directly relevant if you are using a different
PGP Client. It is important to read any manuals included with your specific
PGP client as many do not support all levels of security offered by the
PGP algorithm.

InfiniTime
Keys

In order for you or your intended recipients
to decrypt files encrypted in the PGP format by InfiniTime
the supplied Private Key must be added to the keyring of your PGP Client.
Please refer to the documentation supplied with your PGP Client for instructions
to add a private key to your keyring. In general, there are two types
of keys used with PGP Encryption, a public
key and a private key.

Public Keys:
Public Keys can be distributed freely to individuals who will be sending
you encrypted messages. A Public Key is used to encrypt messages that
can only be decrypted by its associated private key in addition to verifying
your signature. Within InfiniTime
Public Keys are referred to as "PGP Public Keys."

Private
Keys: Private Keys and their associated Passphrase should be kept
private. If an individual should obtain your private key and the respective
passphrase they can read your messages and impersonate you to others.
A private key is used to decrypt incoming messages that were encrypted
using your Public key, in addition to signing outgoing messages. Within
InfiniTime Private Keys
are referred to as "PGP Signature Keys."

If the default installation settings were
used, the PGP Keys can be found on the InfiniTime
Server under C:\Inception\InfiniTime7\PGP\ as shown below.

![](/img/NightShiftSupervisor.png)

Utilizing
Your Own Keys

To use your own keys with InfiniTime
you must change the PGP Configuration within the InfiniTime
Software Application. Before attempting to configure PGP Settings within
InfiniTime please ensure
you have exported your key to a file. InfiniTime
offers three levels of secure PGP encryption, and it is important to understand
each in order to decide which will work best in your company's environment.

Technical Note: When choosing Keys it is important
to keep the recipient in mind. Private keys are generally not shared between
different corporations or individuals as anyone with access to a private
key can impersonate the owner and decrypt files that may be  meant
for only the owner to see. An individual's public key however is shared
and can be distributed freely. You must receive the public key from an
individual in order to encrypt files in a format they can receive and
decrypt. An alternative is to use the default keys provided with InfiniTime, as these can be distributed
freely. While the files will be encrypted in a secure format when using
the default InfiniTime
Keys, it must be understood that there is a larger group of people who
have access to the InfiniTime
Private Key when compared to using user generated keys where the Private
Key is only available to one or at most a small group of people in a single
company. The default InfiniTime
Keys are distributed publicly to all InfiniTime 7 Customers.

- Encryption Only - To encrypt the exported file without signing
  it, only the public key file is required. Be sure to remove the Private/Signature
  key and delete the default passphrase if you only wish to encrypt
  the file. An example configuration is provided below. It should be
  noted that this format is supported by nearly all PGP Client Applications.

- After enabling PGP click on the PGP
  Tab. The default InfiniTime
  PGP Keys are displayed.

![](/img/Sec022.png)

- Click on the Magnify Glass to the
  right of the Signature key to bring up the File Selection Form.

![](/img/CH2_PGP38.gif)

- Leave the field blank and click OK
  to clear the PGP Signature Key.

- Clear
  the PGP Secret Phrase.

![](/img/Timeout_Setting.jpg)

- Click OK to save the changes.

![](/img/Ch2_ValidIP_EmployeeClickChange.jpg)

- Encrypt and Sign - Encrypting and signing the exported file serves
  two purposes. First the file is encrypted in the PGP format which
  requires the recipient to have the Private Key in order to decrypt
  the file. Secondly the file is also signed with your digital signature
  which verifies the file is from you. An example configuration is provided
  below.

- After enabling PGP click on the PGP
  Tab. The default InfiniTime
  PGP Keys are displayed.

![](/img/image438.gif)

- Clear
  the PGP Secret Phrase.

![](/img/CH2_PGP18.gif)

- Click OK to save the changes.

![](/img/CH2_PGP18.gif)

- Encrypt and Sign with Passphrase - This option is the most secure,
  providing both encryption and sender identification. The file is encrypted
  and electronically signed with the sender's digital signature. The
  recipient must also know the pass phrase in order to decrypt the file.
  An example configuration is provided below.

- After enabling PGP click on the PGP
  Tab. The default InfiniTime
  PGP Keys and passphrase are displayed.

![](/img/CH2_PGP31.gif)

- If desired, the keys and passphrase
  can be altered using the Magnify Glass Icons to select Public and
  Private keys provided by the user.

## Essential Takeaways

- Remember, Security Roles dictate what forms, fields, and buttons
  a user can access. Security Filters dictate what users an individual
  can view and / or edit information for using the given forms, fields,
  and buttons their Security Role permits access to.
- It is important to recognize that InfiniTime
  Security Roles include an initial configuration as outlined below.
  Individual users must be assigned to the appropriate security role
  during initial setup in order to limit access as appropriate. Your
  organization may require additional security roles or slight alterations
  to existing configuration in order to best meet the needs of your

  assigned to the supervisor role have the ability to view all information
  within InfiniTime
  though, by default, they are unable to alter information within
  the software. Supervisors are unable to edit software security
  or configure the grid.

- After initial software configuration, the Administrator Security
  Role should be used with care. It is recommended that InfiniTime Administrators utilize
  the Payroll Clerk security role after the initial software configuration
  has been performed. This will reduce the likelihood of accidental
  changes to software settings. Furthermore, it is recommended that
  each InfiniTime Installation
  have only one - at most two - users with Administrative Access. This
  ensures consistent configuration and prevents users from simply changing
  system configuration rules such as Policies, Holidays, Etc.
- General Security Features, as briefly outlined below, are offered
  by the InfiniTime Software.
  These features are optional and may be enabled or disabled at any
  time.

* Display of a CAPTCHA on the Login Form to prevent unauthorized
  access by Scripts and / or Programmatic Tools (Human Verification).
* Ability to expire user passwords on a cyclical basis every
  X Days as configured by the InfiniTime
  Software Administrator.
* Ability for users to change their password upon login at
  their discretion.
* Ability to automatically expire logged in users due to
  inactivity after X minutes as configured by the InfiniTime Software Administrator.

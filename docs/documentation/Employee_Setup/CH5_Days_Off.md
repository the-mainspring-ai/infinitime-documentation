Days Off




# Days Off

Days Off make it possible to schedule an
employee to be absent for a day. When a day off is scheduled employees
will not receive exceptions on the Scheduled Day Off. Days Off are a useful
feature for companies who utilize the Points System and wish to ensure
employees who are approved for an absence will not be penalized.

3. If
   the employee's default schedule is a Day Time Schedule that does not
   cross midnight then check 'Only for Schedules that Start and End on
   Day Off.' If the employee's default schedule crosses midnight, do
   not check 'Only for Schedules that Start and End on Day Off. The table
   below lists examples of employee schedules and shows whether the 'Only
   For Schedules that Start and End on Day Off' button should be checked.

 | Employee Default Schedule for Date of Schedule Day Off | Status of 'Only For Schedules that Start and nd on Day off' option. | 
| --- | --- |
 | 6:00 AM - 3:00 PM | Checked | 
 | 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM | Checked | 
 | 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM | Checked | 
 | 3:00 PM - 11:00 PM | Checked | 
 | 5:00 PM - 2:00 AM | Unchecked | 
 | 6:00 PM - 3:00 AM | Unchecked | 
 | 7:00 PM - 4:00 AM | Unchecked | 
 | 11:00 PM - 7:00 AM | Unchecked | 

Note:
Remember, it is important that the 'Only for Schedules That Start and
End on Day Off' option be checked if the employee's schedule does not
cross midnight for the Schedule Date! This option is used by InfiniTime
to differentiate between Schedules that cross midnight and those that
do not.

Employee Setup




# Employee Setup

The Employee Table is a central part of the InfiniTime
software. Most employee information can be viewed and edited from this
table. After the initial installation employee setup is generally the
first item that needs to be addressed. Employees can either be inserted
manually or imported from a comma-separated file. (.CSV) If possible importing
from a file will often save data entry time. Refer to the Employee Import
section of this document for more information regarding the import feature.

Note: The amount of employees that can be inserted
or imported into InfiniTime
depends on the employee count specified by your InfiniTime
Software license. Should you require additional capacity please contact
the Inception Technologies
Sales Department or your Authorized InfiniTime
Dealer.

Accessing the Employee Table:

1. Click on the Employee Button as shown below:

The Employee Table

The employee table lists all employees that have been inserted into
InfiniTime. Fields within
the employee table are fully customizable and may be altered or reordered
to suit the userâs needs. Refer to the Grid Configuration Section of the
Quick Start Guide: Usage document for more information on grid configuration.
Employee information, settings, and the Employee Timecard Activity table
may be accessed from the employee table.

be removed.

this box is checked inactive employees will be hidden from view.

Employee Update Form

The employee update form is shown when attempting to insert a new employee
or when viewing an employeeâs information. All employee related information
and most employee settings can be edited from within the employee update
form. An overview of each field is provided below.

Required fields are noted as such in the field description. Should a
required field be left blank upon attempting to save the record by clicking
the OK button, the system will prompt the user to fill out the required
fields that were missed.

Demographics

Employee Number:  This
number defaults to the numeric order in which the employee was added to
the database. You can accept the default or change it by typing in the
appropriate Employee number. This number is useful when exporting data
or as an employee point of reference. This field is required.

Inactive: Checking this box
will change the employeeâs status to inactive. Inactive employees do not
count towards the global employee limit, nor will they show up on reports.
Employees that are set to inactive will be highlighted in red in the employee
table.  This feature is useful to keep information about an employee
who may no longer work for the company.  Inactive employees will
not be available for reporting or other InfiniTime
features where you are prompted to select an employee.

First, Middle Initial, and Last Name:
 First and Last Name fields are required.

Address, City, State, County or Province,
Zip/Postal Code, Phone Number:  Enter the appropriate contact
information for the employee.

Gender:  Select the sex
of the employee from the drop down list.

Picture (Optional):  Click
on the Select Picture button to choose an employee image or company logo.
This will bring you to the File Selection window. Choose the path, then
select the file.  The image selected will appear when the employee
logs on and acts as a security measure and reference. InfiniTime
will automatically size the picture to fit a 100X100 pixel area. For best
results select a .jpg file, 100 X 100 pixels, not larger than 64 kb. Choose
the Remove button to remove the image previously selected.

Juno Direct Connection (USB)




# Juno Direct Connection (USB)

The Juno can be connected directly to a USB Port on the InfiniTime server through use of a USB to Serial Converter, which is included with the purchase of a Juno Reader. The included three foot USB to Serial cable permits placement of the Juno within close proximity of the server. If the Juno must be placed farther from the server, a USB Extension cable can be purchased from your local electronics and computer supply store. Standard, or passive, USB Cables are available up to 16.5 Feet while active cables which boost signal strength to allow for longer distances are available in longer lengths.

Benefits of connecting the Juno directly to the InfiniTime Server via USB include fast data transfer, and simplified setup. Follow the steps below to prepare the Juno for connection to the InfiniTime Server via USB:

1. Connect the Juno to the InfiniTime Server using the included USB to Serial Converter.

2. No additional drivers or software is required, the USB Driver is installed during InfiniTime Installation.

3. Follow the steps below to enter the Juno Setup Menu and ready the Juno for Direct Communication.

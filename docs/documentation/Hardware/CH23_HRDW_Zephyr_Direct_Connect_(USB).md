CH23\_HRDW\_Zephyr Direct Connect (USB)




# Zephyr Direct Connect (USB)

The Zephyr can be connected directly to a USB Port on the InfiniTime server through use of a USB to Serial Converter, which is included with the purchase of a Zephyr Reader. The included three foot USB to Serial cable permits placement of the Zephyr within close proximity of the server. If the Zephyr must be placed farther from the server, a USB Extension cable can be purchased from your local electronics and computer supply store. Standard, or passive, USB Cables are available up to 16.5 Feet while active cables which boost signal strength to allow for longer distances are available in longer lengths.

Benefits of connecting the Zephyr directly to the InfiniTime Server via USB include fast data transfer, and simplified setup. Follow the steps below to prepare the Zephyr for connection to the InfiniTime Server via USB:

1. Connect the Zephyr to the InfiniTime Server using the included USB to Serial Converter.

2. No additional drivers or software is required, the USB Driver is installed during InfiniTime Installation.

3. Follow the steps below to enter the Zephyr Setup Menu and ready the Zephyr for Direct Communication.

4. Determine the COM Port assigned to the USB to Serial Converter. Refer to the [Determine COM Port for Zephyr Direct Communication](Dertmining_COM_Port_for_Zephyr_Direct_Connection.md) section of this document.

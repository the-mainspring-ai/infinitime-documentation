### User Interface Overview

The InfiniTime User Interface
was designed with user friendly data entry and navigation in mind. Ease
of use features, as detailed below, are included to assist the user with
identifying and entering required information and navigating throughout
the InfiniTime application.
InfiniTime also includes
duplicate prevention functionality to alert users of duplicate values
in required fields such as the Employee Login ID which specifically require
unique values across all employees in the database. An overview of data
entry, navigation, and form completion related features included within
InfiniTime is provided
below.

### Data Entry & Navigation Assistance

Time
Selection Tool - The time selection tool, referred to as the
Time Picker, provides users with a graphical interface for entering time
into a field. The Time Picker can be used for any field where the timeclock
( ![](/img/ud12.gif)) graphic is displayed. Drop down menus
are used on the Time Picker. When the arrow of a drop down menu is clicked
on, a list of the menu contents is displayed. Only one item in the list
can be selected at a time.

To use the Time Picker:

- Click on the timeclock graphic (![](/img/SoftwareOverview_017.png) )

![](/img/XMLType.gif)

- Use the drop down menu to select the desired hour.
- Use the drop down menu to select the desired minute.
- Use the drop down menu to select the appropriate time of
  day.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_008.png)

- Clicking the Now button will set the drop down windows
  to the current system time.
- Clicking the Select button will enter the time chosen by
  the drop down menus into the form.
- Clicking cancel will close the Time Picker window and return
  to the form. Any information selected in the Time Picker will
  not be entered in the form.

Date
Selection Tool - The date selection tool, referred to as the
Date Picker, provides users with a graphical interface for entering a
date into a field. The Date Picker can be used for any field where the
calendar ( ![](/img/SoftwareOverview_012.png)) graphic is displayed.
The calendar graphic is always displayed to the right of a corresponding
date field. Any information selected with the Date Picker will be entered
into this field.

To Use the Date Picker:

- Click on the calendar graphic. (![](/img/SoftwareOverview_020.png) ) A
  calendar with the current month and day will be displayed.
  If the field corresponding to the Calendar Graphic is blank,
  then the current date will be highlighted in red on the calendar.
  Should a date be in the corresponding field already, then
  that date will be highlighted in red on the calendar.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_003.png)

- Use the drop down menu to select the desired month. The
  left and right arrows can also be used to move ahead or backward
  one month
- Use the drop down menu to select the desired year.

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_001_Btn3_Employee.png)

- Click on the desired day to make your final selection and
  enter the selected values into the date field.

### Date Field Navigation Shortcuts

As an alternative to the Date Picker, InfiniTime Date field entries may
also be altered with the use of keyboard shortcuts.

To use keyboard shortcuts to alter InfiniTime Date Fields:

- Click in the date field that you
  wish to alter. The field is yellow when it is active and ready for
  use with keyboard shortcuts.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_009.png)                            ![](/img/SupervisorName.gif)

- Hit the key that corresponds
  to the action you wish to perform. Keyboard shortcuts are
  listed below.

| Date Field Keyboard Shortcut | Action                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| +                            | Adds one day to the date displayed in the Active Date Field                    |
| -                            | Subtracts one day from the date displayed in the Active Date Field             |
| T or Home                    | Sets the Date in the Active Date Field to Today's Date                         |
| Page Up                      | Subtracts one month from the date displayed in the Active Date Field           |
| Page Down                    | Adds one month to the date displayed in the Active Date Field                  |
| Shift + Home                 | Sets the Date in the Active Date Field to January 1st of the respective Year   |
| Shift + End                  | Sets the Date in the Active Date Field to December 31st of the respective Year |

VCR
Buttons - VCR buttons can be found on nearly every table or
list in the InfiniTime
software. These buttons are used to move between pages and entries in
the list. VCR buttons are always displayed in a set of four.

![](/img/GridTools.gif)

| Description                                                                     | Referred to As        | Graphic |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| The first or left most button, moves to the first record or entry in the table. | âFirstâ VCR Button    |         |
| The second button moves back a record or entry in the table.                    | âPreviousâ VCR Button |         |
| The third button moves forward a record or entry in the table.                  | âNextâ VCR Button     |         |
| The last or right most button moves to the last record or entry in the table.   | âLastâ VCR Button     |         |

The VCR Search Filter allows the user to
enter a word, letter or phrase, and filter the records that can be accessed
with the VCR buttons accordingly.

_For Example_:
In a company with a few hundred employees advancing through the employees
one by one would not be practical. Typing Stephen into the search filter
and clicking on one of the VCR buttons will:

- Search
  through all employee records and fields for âStephenâ
- Employees that live on
  Stephen Lane, with the last name of Stephens, and the first
  name Stephen will be made available for display with the VCR
  buttons.
- The first record or closest
  match to the word in the search filter will be displayed first.
- Using the Next, Previous,
  First, and Last VCR buttons will move among the records available
  for display.

Using a letter or phrase in the search filter
functions similarly to a name or word. All records containing the letter
or phrase will be made available for display with the VCR buttons.

Magnify
Glass - The magnify glass is displayed to the right of every
form item that requires a selection from another table or list with the
InfiniTime software. For
example, when setting up employees, the default department must be selected.
Users have the option of typing the first few letters of a department
name into the field and allowing auto complete to enter the rest of the
department name or viewing the department table using the Magnify Glass.
The magnify glass can be used wherever the ![](/img/LookupFields.gif) icon is
displayed.

To use the Magnify Glass:

- Click on the Magnify glass Icon.
- A list of available items will appear.
- Click on the desired item to select it.
- Click on the Select button.

For Example:

Using the Magnify Glass to select a default
department:

- Click on the Magnify Glass Icon to the right of the Default
  Department field.

![e](/img/image-404.png)

- A list of available departments
  will appear. Click on the desired department to select it.

![](/img/FS4.gif)

- Click on the Select button.
- The selected department is
  entered into the default department field.

![](/img/CH5_DaysOffTab_2.gif)

File Selection
Tool - InfiniTime allows
you select files for import from your local machine into the software.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_004.png)

From anywhere
in the software where it asks you for a file, like in the import tool,
or selecting a picture for the employee update form, you can select a
file by clicking in the browse button and selecting the correct file.
 it will make a copy of that file and place it in the INPUT directory
in the InfiniTime Server.

Example:

How to add
a picture to an employee's record

- On the employee
  update form click on ![](/img/SoftwareOverview_019.png)
- Click on the Browse Button on the File Selection Window

![](/img/active_date_field.gif)

- Browse
  to the Location on your PC with the file you wish to Import
  into InfiniTime

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_029.png)

- Click
  on the file you wish to import to select it then click on
  Open.

![](/img/IT70ServerOnsiteOffSiteClients.JPG)

- The
  full path of the previously selected file will be displayed in the
  File Selection Window. Click OK to import the file and save the image
  as part of the employee's profile.

### Form Completion Assistance

Auto
Complete - All fields within InfiniTime
which reference a separate table support the use of Auto Complete. Fields
which support auto complete are often referred to as lookups, because
these fields look up settings and details configured elsewhere within
InfiniTime. Auto complete
makes it possible for users to partially enter their desired value. InfiniTime will then automatically
complete the rest of the field based on information that has been entered.

Technical Note: If a value is entered in a required
field that does not match an item in the database InfiniTime
will automatically clear the field and prompt the user to enter a valid
value.

_EXAMPLE_:
If the System Administrator account were to be entered for the Supervisor,
typing the first letter of the last name (A) will show the entered information
(A) and automatically complete the rest of the field. Selected information
is added automatically by auto complete.

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_003.png)

Only Lookup Fields which are displayed within
InfiniTime with the Lookup
Magnify Glass, as highlighted in red below, include the auto complete
feature.

![](/img/CSVFileName.gif)

Color
Coded Fields - InfiniTime
uses field coloring to assist users in data entry. Some fields are required,
while many are optional and can be filled out at a later date. The following
table contains information about field coloring.

| Color  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yellow | _Active Cell_: If you click in a field the background turns yellow. This helps users identify which field they are working in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Blue   | _Required Field:_ Any fields in blue must be filled out. Should you miss or skip over any blue fields the InfiniTime software will warn you and prompt you to fill it out properly. InfiniTime permits the Software Administrator to specify fields they wish to consider required throughout the software. This functionality allows the Software Administrator to strictly control and enforce accurate tracking of employee information. For more information refer to [Configuring Required Fields.](Security/Security_Overview.md#sec18_Required_Fields) |
| White  | _Optional Field_: Any fields in white are optional and do not have to be filled out. The software can be used for basic time and attendance purposes without the entry of Optional Fields and values. If it doubt, refer to the Help Documentation for the respective section of the program. All fields and options within InfiniTime are documented with an explanation of how the option can be used within the InfiniTime Electronic Help System.                                                                                                         |

User
Configurable Required Fields - InfiniTime
permits employees with the right to Edit Security to specify fields they
wish to consider required throughout the software. This functionality
allows InfiniTime Software
Administrators to strictly control and enforce accurate tracking of employee
information. For example, though the InfiniTime
Application does not require Employee Address Information, Phone Numbers,
or Emergency Contact Information to function, these fields can be configured
as required fields. Users responsible for entering employees would then
be required to fill out this information before InfiniTime
would allow the employee record to be added to the system. This is simply
an example of how configuring required fields can be used. Nearly every
optional field within the InfiniTime
Application can be set to required if desired by the user. Fields required
for the InfiniTime Application
to function are set to required by default and cannot be set to Optional
by the user.

Configuring Required Fields

- To set required
  fields for a window, open the window you wish to configure and click
  on the Security Key.

Note: You
must be logged in as a user with the right to Edit Security. Refer
to [Security
Roles](Security/Security_Overview.md#sec07_Security_Roles) for more
information on InfiniTime
Security Settings. For clarity purposes, the Employee Update Form will
be used as an example.

![](/img/ch3term_1.gif)

- The Form Security Table will be displayed.
  Click on the Required tab.

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_001.png)

- Search for the
  field(s) you wish to set as required.

![](/img/TerminationReasons02.gif)

- Click on the drop
  down box for each desired field and set the Required Status to True.
  Click Close to save your changes.

![](/img/SoftwareOverview_015.png)

- In this example,
  additional required fields were set for the Employee Update form.
  If a user attempts to add an employee without fill out out all required
  fields InfiniTime will
  prompt the user to complete any items they missed as shown below.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_022.png)

Field
Tool Tips - All update forms within
the InfiniTime Software,
such as the Employee Update Form used for adding employees, the Policy
Update Form used for adding policies, or the Department Update Form used
to update Departments include tool tips intended to prompt users to enter
appropriate data. To view a fields function and / or intended purpose,
simply hover the cursor over the field in question. A tool tip will be
displayed as shown below. Tool tips provide a short summary of expected
field content.

![](/img/XMLDoc.gif)

Duplicate
Prevention - Users should be aware that most tables within
the InfiniTime software
can not contain duplicates. Should the user attempt to enter a duplicate
record, such as two employees with the same Employee Login ID or two Group
Levels of the same name the software will warn the user and prompt for
a different entry. The duplicate entry will not be saved.

Additionally, InfiniTime's
Data Import Tool includes a full-featured duplicate checking scheme in
order to avoid issues that could result should duplicates be present in
the database. If duplicates are found during an import the software will
discard or replace existing records depending on settings chosen during
import. Detailed information regarding import duplicate checking can be
found in the Import section of this document.

### Customizable Table Display: InfiniTime Grid Controls

InfiniTime uses a grid
system to display information in an organized, structured, and standardized
fashion. Each table and list is presented in a similar layout with the
InfiniTime Grid as the
major build block. Use of a grid system helps keep information accessible
and orderly regardless of database size through the use of various features
such as the ability to filter items based on a search term.

The InfiniTime Grid is
fully customizable and can be tailored to meet user needs. Each window
stores a set of configuration settings allowing the user to customize
each window individually.

![](/img/ch3term_4.gif)

The image above, taken from the Employee Table, shows how Grid Controls
and a Search Field are displayed above the grid. Headings appear atop
each grid column to describe the information below. This document uses
the Employee Table as an example, though it should be noted that the grid
controls are displayed on every table where the grid is used.

Click on each control below for more information about its uses. Page
controls are gray when there are no available pages in that direction.
Once multiple pages are available the controls will become active and
turn blue.

Technical Note: Some grid buttons may not be available
depending on your browser. Firefox for example does not support clipboard
access or printing from InfiniTime.

![](/img/EmployeeProfile_002.png)

on the right. This value is updated automatically as additional records
are added to the database. When the number of records exceeds a preset
record per page limit then a new page is created. The number of records
displayed per page can be configured in the Grid Configuration Window.

Next Page

Grid Security, combined
with Security Roles, allow the Software Administrator to configure InfiniTime down to the exact button.
Each employee is assigned an employee role. When the employee signs into
the software with their login ID the software recognizes the employee
role they have been assigned and grants or denies access to the software
based on those rights. Window access is controlled by Security Roles,
while Grid Security is responsible for button access

Two options are provided
for button security, Hidden and Normal. Normal displays the button and
permits interaction. Hidden removes the button from view, effectively
removing access to that portion of the software.

Each security role has
a unique set of button security settings. Be sure to configure Grid Security
for each role based on your companyâs unique access requirements.

Configuring Grid Security:

- Select the security
  role you wish to configure.
- Select
  appropriate settings for each button.

Additional Details on configuring Security within the InfiniTime Software can be found in

Configuration Section](Security/Security_Overview.md#sec01_Security_Overview) of this document.

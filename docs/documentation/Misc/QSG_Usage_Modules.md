InfiniTime Modules




# InfiniTime Modules

InfiniTime is a Web Application
unlike any other, offering a high level of productivity through a powerful
streamlined user interface. The application allows Multitasking and other
features that are normally only available in a Windows application. InfiniTime is not simply a web site.
InfiniTime is a multitasking
Internet application, which will allow you to perform several tasks at
the same time. This eliminates the need to interrupt the task at hand
to open an additional browser for another purpose. InfiniTime
securely tracks, calculates, and provides reports on employee timecard
activity. InfiniTime also
provides features which assist with employee tracking and other Human
Resource tasks. Employee timecard information may be gathered from multiple
sources including hardware readers ranging from biometric readers, which
use the employeeâs hand or fingerprint for verification, to badge based
systems. InfiniTime also
includes a web-based employee module, which allows employees to punch
in or out as an alternative to using the hardware based systems.

Traditional time sheet or time card calculations are unnecessary because
the system automatically calculates regular hours, overtime, vacation
time, sick time, and holidays. The multitasking nature of InfiniTime allows multiple parts of
the software to be accessed at the same time within a single browser window.
Local printer usage, detailed security options, and full use of the software
through a single browser are some of the main features that separate InfiniTime from other web applications.
The security system allows InfiniTime
software administrators to configure and assign security rights for specific
users. Through proper use of security it is possible to configure user
access down to specific buttons within a screen.  The following modules
compose the InfiniTime
Software Application:

 | Manager Module | Allows you to configure business rules, maintain employee information, configure program interface, perform payroll functions, print reports, perform Human Resource functions, and perform system maintenance. | 
| --- | --- |
 | Employee Module | Allows the employee to Punch in or out of work, view current and archived timecard information, print selected reports, request time off, and view vacation accruals. This moduleâs security can be customized by Software Administrators in order to allow or prevent access to certain functions. | 
 | Punch Module | Permits employees to punch only. No other software access is available in this module. | 
 | Escort | Allows you to create custom portals to the InfiniTime software for ease of use. Virtually every function within the InfiniTime software may be assigned to a button on an escort window, making it possible to place everyday tasks in one easy to access location. Once an escort window has been designed it may be assigned to groups of employees or individuals. There is no limit to the amount of escort windows that may be defined. If desired you may configure an escort for each employee within your company. |

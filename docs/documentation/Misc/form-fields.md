## Required Fields

Required Fields allow InfiniTime Administrators to configure which fields must be filled when creating new records. These settings are managed through the Form Security Table, accessible via the Security Key on most Update Forms.

### Key Points:

- Required Field settings apply to all users (not role-specific)
- System-required fields cannot be made optional
- Primarily used for configuring required Human Resources details on Employee Profiles
- Not all forms support Required Field configuration (e.g., Quick Punch Update Form)

### How to Configure Required Fields:

1. Open the Update Form you want to modify (e.g., Employee Update Form)
2. Click the Security Configuration Icon (Security Key) at the bottom of the window
3. In the Form Security Table, select the Required Tab
4. Use the dropdown options to set required fields as desired
5. Click Close to save changes

Note: Required fields will be shaded in blue, and users will receive a warning if they attempt to save a record with blank required fields.

## Default Values

Default Values enable Administrators to set pre-filled values for form fields. These settings are configured through the Form Security Table's Default Tab.

### Key Points:

- Default Value settings apply to all users
- Values must match the field type (e.g., numeric fields require numeric values)
- Commonly used for standardizing time ranges or frequently used values
- Not all forms support Default Value configuration (e.g., Quick Punch Update Form)
- Useful for fields that typically use the same value across most records

### How to Configure Default Values:

1. Open the Update Form you want to modify
2. Click the Security Configuration Icon (Security Key) at the bottom of the window
3. In the Form Security Table, select the Default Tab
4. Set the desired default values for applicable fields
5. Click Close to save changes

Note: Default values will automatically populate when users create new records using the form, such as filling in standard time ranges for Time Off Requests.

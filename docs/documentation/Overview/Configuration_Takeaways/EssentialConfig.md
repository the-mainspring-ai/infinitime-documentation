## InfiniTime Configuration - Takeaways & Essential Concepts

As a versatile Time and Attendance Solution with the ability to meet
the needs of enterprise organizations with a single location to organizations
with multiple locations and unique requirements InfiniTime
offers a variety of features. It is important to note that nearly all
features within the InfiniTime
Time and Attendance application are optional and can be configured or
ignored (IE: Disabled) to meet the needs of the organization. With this
in mind, the table below provides a list of specific features that must
be configured in order to successfully transfer employee hours and earnings
to a Payroll Application - either manually using InfiniTime
Reports and Data Entry or automatically using the InfiniTime
Payroll Export Feature. For clarity, each feature and its place in the
day to day operational use of InfiniTime,
or process flow, is also provided below.

Payroll Clerks, and / or Supervisors to take specific actions within InfiniTime. Several such tasks are
outlined below.

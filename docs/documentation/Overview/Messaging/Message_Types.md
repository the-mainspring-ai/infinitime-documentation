Message Types

# Message Types

InfiniTime includes three separate message types. Each type of message has a specific purpose. A detailed outline of these message types is provided below:

Notes

A note is a simple comment and includes a text message and description. Notes default to an employeeâs supervisor as the recipient though they can be sent to any employee. A note can also be sent to multiple employees at once. Again, no privacy should be assumed when sending notes within the InfiniTime software, as any employee with access to the senderâs employee record can view a full account of all messages sent by the employee.

Schedule Change Requests

A schedule change request includes all facets of a note, with additional information required to request a change in an employeeâs schedule. Schedule Change requests are sent to an employee's supervisor by default though multiple recipients can be specified by the user if the 'Allow Mutiple Request Recipients' option is enabled. Recipients can then approve or deny the request at their discretion.

An approved schedule change request will alter the employeeâs schedule with a GANTT chart entry. This ensures the change will override any type of schedule the employee may have, as GANTT chart entries take precedence over all schedule types. A reply will also be sent to the employee automatically notifying them that the request was approved.

Should the request be denied the employeeâs schedule will not be altered and a message will be automatically sent to the employee informing them their request was denied.

Time Off Requests

A Time Off request includes all facets of a note, with additional information required to request Time Off. Time Off requests are sent to an employee's supervisor by default though multiple recipients can be specified by the user if the 'Allow Mutiple Request Recipients' option is enabled. Recipients can then approve or decline the request as their discretion.

An approved schedule change request will alter the employeeâs schedule with a GANTT chart entry. This ensures the change will override any type of schedule the employee may have, as GANTT chart entries take precedence over all schedule types. An other activity entry will also be inserted into the Employeeâs Timecard Activity. Managers pick the other activity type upon approving the vacation request. Through use of other activity types, an approved vacation can be either paid or unpaid. A reply will also be sent to the employee automatically notifying them that the request was approved.

Should the request be denied the employeeâs schedule will not be altered and a message will be automatically sent to the employee informing them their request was denied. Other activity entries will not be inserted.

Automated Messages

Under specific circumstances InfiniTime sends automated messages in order to notify supervisors of the actions their employees have recently performed. If an employee should alter their personal information within the InfiniTime Employee Module a message will be sent to the employee's supervisor to provide notification of the changes. The supervisor may then check the employee's record to note the altered employee information.

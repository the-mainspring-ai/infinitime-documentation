Electronic License Updates (Internet Access Required from InfiniTime Server)




# Updating Software License - Additional Purchases

Customers have the option of purchasing additional software features, increasing the maximum employee count, or adding additional hardware after the initial purchase. After a purchase order is placed please allow twenty - four hours for order processing. When the order has been processed and the license has been updated an email will be sent to the customer notifying them that their license is ready for update, for this reason it is important to ensure the email address included with your purchase is correct.

Once you have received a confirmation email, simply perform the steps below from within the InfiniTime Application to update your license. Keep in mind, it is necessary to connect to the InfiniTime Server to perform these steps. The Software License cannot be updated from an InfiniTime Client Machine.

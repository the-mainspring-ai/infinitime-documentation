In Line Timecard Editing




# In Line Timecard Editing

When it is necessary to edit timecards, such as when an employee forgets to punch or when employees have legitimate excuses for arriving late or leaving early, In Line Edit is by far the most efficient method for quickly correcting timecards. In Line Edit, combined with the Delayed Save feature as well as the tab and arrow keys for moving between fields and records, behaves in a spreadsheet-like manner which most users are familiar with. Details regarding the use of In Line Edit and related features are outlined below.

In Line Editing - Navigation

When using In Line Edit it is important to understand how to move focus from one record to another in the Timecard Table. When a record is highlighted and the cursor is located in a cell on the record, the record is said to have focus. Focus must be removed from a record before any changes made to the record can be saved. The down arrow key will remove focus from the highlighted record. Tab can also be used to move between fields on a single Timecard Record. These concepts are best explained through example. Multiple examples of in line editing are provided below.

Traditional Timecard: In Line Editing - Saving Changes to a Single Timecard Record

1. If there is only a single record for the selected date range, focus must be removed from the record before any changes will be saved. In the example below, an employee missed a punch on the first day of a pay period.

2. In Line Edit refers to entering changes directly in the timecard record. Use tab to move the cursor to the Out Date field and set the desired date. Then use Tab again to move the cursor to the Out Time field and set the desired time. Alternatively, simply click in the Out Date and the Out Time and enter the desired values.

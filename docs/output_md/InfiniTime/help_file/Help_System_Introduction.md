for customers with a valid support contract. It should be noted that updates
are available in this way only for products you already own. For example
customers who own InfiniTime

Remote Sites & Ethernet Terminals

Customers considering the use of an Ethernet
Terminal such as the Scout or Thor at a remote site should familiarize
themselves with the possible scenarios involved in configuring an Ethernet
Terminal for remote access. The [Ethernet
Hardware Terminals: Remote Sites](ethernet_hardware_terminals__configuration_scenarios_for_remote_sites.md) document provides a detailed description
of six individual methods for communicating with Remote Ethernet Terminals
including a glossary defining common Ethernet and Networking Terms. This
document is intended as a complete reference for customers with an interest
in configuring Ethernet Time & Attendance Data Collection terminals
at remote sites.

Software Troubleshooting

A variety of operating system settings, browser configuration settings,
and hardware related issues can lead to potential issues with the InfiniTime Software. Should you receive
an error message when attempting to login to or while working with the
InfiniTime Application
please refer to the Troubleshooting Section of this document. Many common
issues on client machines are caused by Internet Explorer Security Settings,
Popup Blockers, and software that can be considered spyware such as Google
or Yahoo Toolbar. If you are experiencing issues accessing the InfiniTime Application and you have
a toolbar such as Google Toolbar or Yahoo Toolbar installed, Inception
Technologies recommends uninstalling the toolbar in order to avoid issues
resulting from pop up blockers. For additional information the software
troubleshooting sections are listed under Chapter 7 of the Electronic
Installation Manual.

If you are experiencing script errors it is important to understand
the most common issues which may lead to script errors.  It is not
uncommon for temporary internet files to be altered by a third party program
such as an anti-spyware or antivirus application. In many cases this can
be resolved by simply clearing the Temporary Internet Files, which will
automatically be recreated after you access the InfiniTime
Software. Refer to the [Troubleshooting
Section on Script Errors and Temporary Internet Files](Script_Errors_and_Temporary_Internet_Files.md) for more information.
If this does not resolve the problem it may be necessary to clear the
ASP.NET Temporary File Cache stored on the InfiniTime
Server. Please refer to the [Troubleshooting
Section on Clearing the ASP.NET Temporary File Cache](Script_Errors_and_ASP.NET_Temporary_Files.md) for more information.

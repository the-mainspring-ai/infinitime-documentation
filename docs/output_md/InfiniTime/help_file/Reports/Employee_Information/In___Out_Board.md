Notes/Usage:

This report is useful to see which employees are currently clocked in or out and can be used as an 'On Premise' report for security and emergency purposes. The footer option is particularly useful for this function as it displays a total count of employees who are clocked in and clocked out which can be used to take a head count.

Options:

| Option | Default Value | Description |
| Allow Graphics On the Report? | Yes | This option allows you to choose if you want to print the InfiniTime 7.0 logo on the report. |
| Display In and Out Time | No | This option will allow you to show the time at which employees last clocked in or out on the report. |

Selecting the 'Location' group level would sort employees according to their assigned location. |

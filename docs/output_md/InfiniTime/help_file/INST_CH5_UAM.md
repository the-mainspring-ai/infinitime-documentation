Universal Access Methods




# Universal Access Methods

Universal Access Methods
can be used to access InfiniTime
from any machine on the local network with internet access or any remote
machine with internet access. In order for the universal access methods
to function the InfiniTime
Software must be published to the Internet.

Domain Name

Accessing the InfiniTime
software from any location including on-site and off-site Clients can
be simplified through use of a domain name. Domain names allow an easy
to remember name to be used in order to direct a web browser to a specific
web site. For example the domain name InfiniTimeOnline.com
will forward a web browser to the demo website for the InfiniTime 7.0 software product.

To access the InfiniTime
Software through use of a Domain Name:

Replace InfiniTimeOnline.comâ
with your domain name.

 | Module Name | Address | 
| --- | --- |
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Manager Module | http://www.InfiniTimeOnline.com/IInfiniTimeManagerModule/ | 
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Employee Module | http://www.InfiniTimeOnline.com/InfiniTimeEmployeeModule/ | 
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Escort | http://www.InfiniTimeOnline.com/InfiniTimeEscort/ | 
 | InfiniTIme 7.0 Punch Module | http://www.InfiniTimeOnline.com/InfiniTimePunch/ | 

Technical Note:
Domain Names must be purchased from a registrar and configured to forward
traffic to your InfiniTime 7.0 Serverâs public IP address. Your network
administrator can assist with this configuration.

Technical Note: Internet access is required in
order to use the domain name access method.

InfiniTime
7.0 Server IP address

The InfiniTime 7.0 software
can be accessed from off-site Clients though the use of the Serverâs public
IP address. Directing a web browser directly to the InfiniTime
7.0 Serverâs IP address eliminates the need for a domain though it is
not as easy to remember. Your public IP address can be obtained from your
Internet Service Provider. On-Site Clients must use the Server's local
IP Address to access the InfiniTime
Software.

Replace â12.47.180.99â in the addresses below with the public IP address
of your server in order to access the InfiniTime
7.0 software.

 | Module Name | Address | 
| --- | --- |
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Manager Module | http://www.12.47.180.99.com/InfiniTimeManagerModule/ | 
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Employee Module | http://www.12.47.180.99.com/InfiniTimeEmployeeModule/ | 
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Escort | http://www.12.47.180.99.com/InfiniTimeEscort/ | 
 | InfiniTime 7.0 Punch Module | http://www.12.47.180.99.com/InfiniTimePunch/ |

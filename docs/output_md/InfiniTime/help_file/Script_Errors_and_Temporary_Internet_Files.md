Script Errors and Temporary Internet Files




# Script Errors and Temporary Internet Files

If you should experience script errors please close your InfiniTime 7 software and clear your Temporary Internet Files before contacting Technical Support for assistance. It is not uncommon for temporary internet files to be altered by a third party program such as an anti-spyware or antivirus application. In many cases this can be resolved simply clearing the Temporary Internet Files, which will automatically be recreated after you access the InfiniTime Software.

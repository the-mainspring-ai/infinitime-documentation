# InfiniTime Deployment Options

Standalone InfiniTime
Server

![](/img/image-404.png)

Standalone Installations require only a server. In a Standalone Installation
the server hosts all InfiniTime
files and information. The InfiniTime
software can be viewed using a web browser in the same way it would be
accessed on a Client machine. A stand-alone installation requires an Internet
connection during installation for registration purposes only. After installation
an Internet connection is not required for use of the software.

Technical Note: Standalone Installation follows
the same initial install procedures as the other deployment methods. The
major difference lies in the configuration and setup of Client machines.
For the Standalone InfiniTime
Server there simply are no Client machines. Installation is finished once
the server is setup and configured. Refer to the Client Access section
for instructions on accessing the software.

Technical Note: Without an Internet connection
certain features of the software, such as emailing reports, will not be
available.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with On-Site Clients

As shown, this server is connected to a Local Area Network and hosts
the InfiniTime software
for Client machines that are on the local network. Employees and Managers
can access the software and all of its features from any computer on the
network.

Technical Note: While a hub will function as shown
in the diagram, a switch is recommended. On a 100 Mb/s Ethernet network
a switch can provide 100 Mb/s to each computer connected to its ports,
assuming there is only one computer per port. A hub on the other hand
shares its bandwidth between all of the computers connected to it. A four-port
hub could supply at maximum only 25Mb/s bandwidth to each computer.

Onsite InfiniTime
Server with Off-Site Clients

As pictured, this server has a Static ip address and uses an Internet
service such as T1, DSL, or Cable to connect to the Internet. Any employee
or affiliate armed with the proper web site address and their login information
can log into the InfiniTime
software in order to run the InfiniTime
Labor Management Software.

Off-Site Clients

Combining the first two options provides a versatile deployment alternative
separating Web Applications from other software applications. Employees
on the local network and abroad have full access to all of InfiniTime's features. Remote users
need only a computer or laptop, an Internet connection, and their login
information to connect to the InfiniTime software.

Technical Note: All InfiniTime
7.0 Deployment Options begin with a Server Installation. Additional setup
is covered in the Client Access section of this document.

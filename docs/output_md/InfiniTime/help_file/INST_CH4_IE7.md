Trusted sites are used to indicate web sites that you trust. By adding the InfiniTime 7.0 website to your trusted sites you are implying that information and files from this web site are safe. Trusted Sites allow you to use lower security settings for sites that you trust while keeping you protected during regular web browsing. Remember, this section is purely informational. The below settings are configured during installation on the InfiniTime Server and require no action from the user.

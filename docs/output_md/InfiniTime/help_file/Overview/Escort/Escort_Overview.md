Escort Overview

# Escort Overview

InfiniTime Escort allows
the user to build a customized window with everyday tasks available at
your fingertips in one place. An unlimited number of escort windows can
be configured making it possible for each employee to have a customized
portal to the InfiniTime
Software Application if desired. In most cases, customers who choose to
implement Escort will create one Escort Window for each set of employees
responsible for specific tasks.

Escort....

- Serves as a Customized Portal to the InfiniTime
  Application
- Permits a completely user customizable layout of InfiniTime Buttons and controls with
  the ability to add labels, links, and images.
- Very useful for employees who are not highly computer literate
  or who might be overwhelmed by the number of features in the manager
  module.
- Escort users donât have to learn the entire application â only
  the areas they use on a regular basis. IE: You want to run a report.
  With escort the user only has to click on a single button where in
  the manager module they would have to Open the Report Library, Find
  the Report they want, Configure Report Settings, and finally review
  the results.

For example, using Escort Windows with clip art images and text labels
can create a guided work flow for Daily Tasks, Weekly Tasks, and even
Monthly or tasks related to a specific function such as Processing Payroll.
An example Escort Window is provided below.

# Designing Escort Windows

Escort Windows must be designed before they can be assigned to or utilized
by employees. When designing Escort Windows, it is important to keep an
employee's role within the InfiniTime
Software in mind. For example, managers will need access to their employeeâs
Timecards and information as well as reports.

### To open the Escort Design Window for a specific Escort Window:

- Select an existing Escort Setting  then click on the Design
  Button. If no Escort Settings exist in your database the Design button
  will not be displayed on the Escort Settings Description Table. Use
  the Insert button to first define a Description and the First Tab
  Text for a new escort window.
- The Escort Design window will be displayed as shown below. Notice
  how each control on the window is shown individually. Controls can
  be moved using Drag and Drop or resized by hovering the cursor over
  a control's outer edge.

![](/img/image-404.png)

- Initially, the Escort Window is a blank canvas with only a single
  tab. The Right Click Menu of the Escort Design Window can be used
  to add additional tabs and controls such as Labels, Hyperlinks, Images,
  and Buttons.

![](/img/image-404.png)

- To add controls to the Escort Window, simply right click to display
  the available actions then Left click on the action you wish to perform.
  Each action is detailed below.

## Escort Design Actions

A gray bar separates escort Design Action
sets. Each set of actions performs related functions such as altering

# Exporting Escorts

In order to reduce design time and make it possible to transfer previously
designed Escort Windows from Installation to Installation, Escort Windows
can now be exported from the InfiniTime
Application. Upon export, Escort Windows are saved to a file with an extension
of .ESB which can be shared between InfiniTime
Users and imported into the InfiniTime
Application. The Import and Export features for Escort have some limitations
as listed below:

- Escort Windows can only be exported
  from the InfiniTime
  Server. The Export Button is not displayed on the Escort Settings
  Description Table when InfiniTime
  is accessed remotely,  or if Trusted Sites and Active X Controls
  are not configured properly when InfiniTime
  is accessed from the InfiniTime
  Server.
- Escort Windows can only be exported
  using Internet Explorer 7 and later. Safari and Mozilla Firefox do
  not support this feature.
- Auto Report Schedules associated with
  a Printer are not transferred by the Export feature. Individual Printers
  are installation specific, for this reason this information cannot
  be transferred from machine to machine.

## Escort Window Design Theory and Examples

Within the Escort Module, software access is limited by the design of
an employeeâs escort window. Employees will only be able to access parts
of the software that correspond to buttons on their assigned escort window.
Once an employee has opened a window, for example the Timecard Table,
their access is further limited by the employeeâs security role and its
configuration. In many situations it may be desirable to configure additional
security roles for escort employees in order to further define access
rights within the InfiniTime
Software. Refer to the Security Section of this document for more information
about configuring InfiniTime
security settings.

### Escort for Employees

Employees generally have little to no access to the InfiniTime
software. Escort would generally be used to grant very limited access,
as controlled by security role configuration and security filters, to
the following items:

- Employee Table
- Timecard Activity Table
- In & Out Board

### Escort for Supervisors

Supervisors, or those in charge of a group of employees, require additional
access to the InfiniTime
software based upon the duties assigned to them. In some cases all timecard
activity will be edited and approved by supervisors, while in other cases
the software administrator or payroll clerks may take over this duty.
In general, supervisors require access to the following items:

Software Access:

- Employee Table
- Company Activity Table
- Department Table
- Schedule Table
- Report Library
- In & Out Board

Reporting Functions:

- Exception Detail
- Timecard Detail
- Timecard Summary
- In
  & Out Board
- Postable Schedule

### Escort For Payroll Clerks

Payroll clerks, similar to managers, require additional access to the
InfiniTime software based upon the duties assigned to them. Payroll Clerks
work with all employee activity, including their own in some cases. In
general, access to the following items is required for Payroll Clerks:

Employee Table

Timecard Table

Report Library

In & Out Board

Payroll Export Table

Other Activity Types Table

### Escort For Administrators

Software administrators generally require access to nearly every facet
of the software. All items available within the escort module will be
of use at one point or another for the software administrator. Generally,
the administrator will use the Manager Module itself for software configuration
and access purposes. Should the administrator choose to configure an escort
window for their use, all items, as listed in the Escort Settings section
of this document, will be of use at one point or another. Personal preference
will be a part of designing an administratorâs escort window, as they
will always have access to the manager module if needed.

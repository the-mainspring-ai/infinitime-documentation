Trusted Sites allow you to use lower security settings for sites that you trust while keeping you protected during regular web browsing. Remember, this section is purely informational.

In order for a web server to use HTTPS the Administrator of the server must setup a secure certificate. HTTPS is not required for InfiniTime 7.0

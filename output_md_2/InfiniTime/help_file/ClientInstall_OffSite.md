2. Copy the Client Installer to a removable storage device such as a USB Drive, or to a Shared Network Drive or an FTP Site that can be accessed from client machines.
3. Login to the Client Machine you wish to configure for use with InfiniTime and copy the Client Installer to the desktop of the Client Machine.
4. Double Click on the Client Installer to start the Client Installation.
5. Follow the On Screen Instructions.

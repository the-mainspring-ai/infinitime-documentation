Initial Software Activation




# Initial Electronic Software Activation

The InfiniTime Software must be activated prior to inserting employees or using Time and Attendance Readers with the InfiniTime software. Prior to activation, the InfiniTime Software remains in Demo Mode which permits a maximum of five employees and does not permit Time and Attendance Readers to be added to the software. Outside of these limitations, Demo mode will permit full use of the InfiniTime 7.0 product for 30 days, after which the product will cease to function. Follow the steps below to perform the Initial Software Activation.

Moving InfiniTime to a New Server




# Moving InfiniTime to a New Server

If desired, the InfiniTime application can be moved to a new physical server after the initial Software License Activation procedure has been performed. Assistance from Inception Technologies is required prior to the move to clear the association between the original server and the product license key. If you would like to move your InfiniTime Software to a new server simply contact the Inceptiton Technologies Support Team or your Authorized InfiniTime Dealer for assistance.

Please provide 48 hours of notice before the scheduled cut over from the original server to the new server when requesting assistance with a server move to allow your Inception Technologies Support Representative or Authorized InfiniTime Dealer to review the hardware and software specifications of the new server environment in order to ensure they meet the minimum requirements.

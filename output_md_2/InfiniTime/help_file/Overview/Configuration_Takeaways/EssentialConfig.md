## InfiniTime Configuration - Takeaways & Essential Concepts

As a versatile Time and Attendance Solution with the ability to meet
the needs of enterprise organizations with a single location to organizations
with multiple locations and unique requirements InfiniTime
offers a variety of features. It is important to note that nearly all
features within the InfiniTime
Time and Attendance application are optional and can be configured or
ignored (IE: Disabled) to meet the needs of the organization. With this
in mind, the table below provides a list of specific features that must
be configured in order to successfully transfer employee hours and earnings
to a Payroll Application - either manually using InfiniTime
Reports and Data Entry or automatically using the InfiniTime
Payroll Export Feature. For clarity, each feature and its place in the
day to day operational use of InfiniTime,
or process flow, is also provided below.

InfiniTime Day to Day Operational
Use - Maintenance Tasks

During normal day to day business operations, certain events will require
InfiniTime Software Administrators,
Payroll Clerks, and / or Supervisors to take specific actions within InfiniTime. Several such tasks are
outlined below.

| Event | Task Description |
| Employee Turnover | * When an employee is terminated, their employee record should   be set to Inactive. Inactive Employee records do not count   toward the maximum employee count per your organization's   InfiniTime   Software License. |
| New Hire | * When a new employee is hired, they must be added to the   InfiniTime   Software using the Employee Table. Alternatively, employee   records may also be imported using the Import Tool. After   adding a new employee, be sure to assign all settings (Security   Role, Policy, Department / Job / Task, Holiday Type, Accrual   Type, Groups etc.) to the employee as appropriate. |
| New Year | * Holiday Dates within InfiniTime   are configured on a year by year basis. Holiday Dates must   be configured for each Calendar Date on which employees receive   benefits. Refer to the Holidays Section of this document for   additional details on configuring Holiday Dates. |
| Change in Time and Attendance or Paid / Unpaid Leave Policies | * Review and Alter InfiniTime   Policies, Holidays, Accruals, Other Activity Types, and /   or Schedules to reflect your organization's new rule set. |
| Employee Hours and Earnings Exported by InfiniTime do not match those exported from the existing Time and Attendance Solution during the Parallel Payroll Run | * Review Employee Timecards. Ensure timecards match in both   systems. * Review Other Activity Types within InfiniTime.   One or more Hours and Earning Types may exist in the Current   Time and Attendance System that were not added to InfiniTime. * Review Policy Configuration within InfiniTime.   Policy settings may need to be adjusted and fine tuned during   the few Payroll Periods. |

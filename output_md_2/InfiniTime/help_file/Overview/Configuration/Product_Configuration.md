InfiniTime Configuration




# InfiniTime Configuration

### Job Costing Introduction

Job Costing makes it possible for the user to track employee hours under
various levels. Job Costing is generally used in businesses where employee
labor costs are of special interest when compared to the cost of finished
goods such as manufacturing or production related organizations. Even
though Job Costing adds a great deal of functionality to the InfiniTime Application it is not used
by all companies and as such is disabled by default. Job Costing related
fields such as Job and Task will not be displayed within the application
if Job Costing is disabled.

### Job Costing Benefits

In general Job Costing involves the tracking
of three types of information - Internal Departments, Job / Customer,
and Task as outlined below.

Internal
Departments may refer to separate categories of activity within
an organization. Tracking Internal Departments with Job Costing makes
it possible for an organization to identify how labor costs are distributed
throughout various categories within the company. Â Example Activity
Categories are Administration, Installation, Construction, Electrical
etc.

Job / Customer
refer to individual Job Numbers or Customer accounts under which specific
tasks are performed. Tracking Jobs / Customers with Job Costing makes
it possible for an organization to clearly identify all labor related
costs for a specific Customer or Job. Jobs / Customers are generally assigned
an Invoice or Job Number which can be used within the organization to
refer to the Job.

Tasks
refer to actions performed by employees under a specific Activity Category
or Job / Customer. Tracking Tasks makes it possible for an organization
to clearly identify the amount of time generally required to perform a
specific task. Once this is understood employees who take exceptionally
long to perform a given task are easily identified. Tasks vary based upon
the working environment. Example tasks for a Custom Cabinet Shop might
include Framing, Sanding, Staining, Painting, and Installation.

Premium
Pay can be used to define Premiums, or bonuses in the form of an
increased wage, which are paid to employees based upon the Shift, Department,
Job, or Task the employee works on. Refer to the [Pay
Premium Introduction](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Pay_Premium_Introduction.md) for more information.

### Job Costing Levels

While there are various benefits for tracking
these items they may not be of interest to all companies. Customers may
choose to track one, two, or all of these items.

Single Level:
If only one of the above information types is of interest to your company
Job Costing is not required. Simply configure Departments to represent
the appropriate Internal Departments, Jobs / Customers, and Tasks within
your organization. It is important to note employee activity can only
be associated with one Department at a time.

Two Levels: If
two of the above information types are of interest to your company both
Departments and Jobs must be configured within the InfiniTime
Application. It should be noted that InfiniTime
Departments are required. All employee activity will be associated with
a department. In a two level system the first level generally corresponds
to Internal Departments or Jobs / Customers while the second level corresponds
to Jobs. Departments are considered the first Job Costing Level within
InfiniTime and should be
configured with the appropriate information. For example, if Internal
Departments such as Administration, Construction, Installation etc. are
to be your first Job Costing Level then these items should be configured
as Departments within the InfiniTime
System. Alternatively Jobs / Customers may be used as your first Job Costing
level. In this case Job Numbers or Customer Names should be configured
as Departments within InfiniTime.
Jobs are considered the second Job Costing Level within InfiniTime and should be configured
with any Tasks that apply to your company such as Welding or Painting.

NOTE: In some scenarios only Jobs / Customers
and Tasks or Internal Departments and Tasks are of interest to a specific
company. However the company may use two levels of tasks. In this scenario
three job costing levels are used for only two items of information. Jobs
/ Customers or Internal Departments would correspond to Departments within
InfiniTime. The first task
level would refer to Jobs within InfiniTime
and the second task level would refer to Tasks within InfiniTime.
The chart below shows an example of this configuration.

| Job / Customer (Configured As InfiniTime Departments) | Task 1 (Configured as InfiniTime Jobs) | Task 2 (Configured as InfiniTime Tasks) |
| Invoice 1160072 | Installation | Old Cabinet Removal |
| Invoice 1160072 | Installation | Hang Wall Cabinets |
| Invoice 1160072 | Installation | Install Base Cabinets |

Three Levels: If
all three of the above information types are of interest to your company
Departments, Jobs, and Tasks must be configured within the InfiniTime Application however the
type of information configured within Departments, Jobs, and Tasks differs
from company to company. It is important to recognize Departments are
required within InfiniTime.
All employee activity is associated with a department. For this reason
most companies choose to configure Internal Departments as Departments
within InfiniTime. Example
job costing configurations using Three Levels with Internal Departments,
Job / Customers, and Tasks are provided below.

| Internal Department (Configured As InfiniTime Departments) | Customer (Configured as InfiniTime Jobs) | Task (Configured as InfiniTime Tasks) |
| Frame Construction | Gilbert's Crab Boats | Welding |
| Hull Construction | Gilbert's Crab Boats | Sanding |
| Assembly | Gilbert's Crab Boats | Assembly |

| Internal Department (Configured As InfiniTime Departments) | Job Number (Configured as InfiniTime Jobs) | Task (Configured as InfiniTime Tasks) |
| Frame Construction | 17251 | Welding |
| Hull Construction | 17251 | Sanding |
| Assembly | 17251 | Assembly |

Three Levels w/ Internal
Departments, Customers, & Jobs: In
some scenarios Tasks are not of interest while both Customers and individual
Jobs must be tracked. With this configuration the first level generally
corresponds to Internal Departments while the second and third levels
correspond to Customers and Jobs respectively. Remember all activity is
associated with a department within InfiniTime.
An example of this configuration is shown below.

| Internal Department (Configured As InfiniTime Departments) | Customer (Configured as InfiniTime Jobs) | Job Number (Configured as InfiniTime Tasks) |
| Custom Programming | Jan's Software | 100235 |
| Custom Reports | Wellington School District | 200257 |
| Technical Support | Wellington School District | 300987 |

Three levels w/ Two Levels
as Tasks: In some scenarios Customers
/ Jobs are not of interest while Internal Departments and multiple task
levels must be tracked. With this configuration the first level generally
corresponds to Internal Department while the second and third levels correspond
to tasks. An example of this configuration is shown below.

| Internal Department (Configured As InfiniTime Departments) | Task 1 (Configured InfiniTime Jobs) | Task 2 (Configured as InfiniTimeTasks) |
| Cabinets | Installation | Old Cabinet Removal |
| Cabinets | Installation | Hang Wall Cabinets |
| Cabinets | Installation | Install Base Cabinets |
| Administration | Auditing | Taxes |

Ultimately the type of information tracked
using Departments, Jobs, and Tasks is up to the user. Simply because they
are referred to as 'Departments' or 'Jobs' does not mean they must be
used for internal departments and job numbers. When configuring Job Costing
users must first identify what types of information will be tracked by
job costing. Once the information to be tracked has been identified a
hierarchy is generally evident when looking at how the items relate to
each other. This hierarchy can then be used to organize the items into
three levels. The highest level should be configured as departments within
InfiniTime, the next as
Jobs, and the last as Tasks. While a maximum of three levels are available
it is not necessary to use all three levels. For two level systems InfiniTime Departments correspond
to the first Job Costing Level while Jobs correspond to the second Job
Costing Level.

### Labor Transfer Methods

Three methods are available for transferring
between Departments, Jobs, and Tasks depending on the chosen solution
for gathering employee activity. Two methods are available for choosing
from Departments, Jobs, and Tasks using a hardware terminal. The method
used for selecting a specific Department, Job, or Task differs depending
on terminal model. A list of the method supported by each terminal is
provided below. The first method for selecting Departments, Jobs, and
Tasks is a simple list format. All available Departments, Jobs, or Tasks
are displayed in a list. Employees can scroll up and down the list using
buttons on the reader to select the desired item. The second method for
selecting Departments, Jobs, and Tasks is by Item Number. In this case
an item refers to a specific Department, Job, or Task. The item number
corresponds to the Department Number for Departments, the Job Number for
Jobs, and the Task Number for Tasks. When employees press the Labor Switching
or Transfer Button they will be prompted to enter the Department Number
to select the Department they wish to work under followed by the Job and
Task number if applicable. When many items are available Transferring
by Item Number is the most efficient transfer method though steps must
be taken to ensure it is configured appropriately.

1.) Identify the number of Departments, Jobs,
and or Tasks which will be tracked for Job Costing Purposes. This information
is invaluable when designing a numbering system for Departments, Tasks
and Jobs.

2.) Determine item number length. Item Numbers
for Departments and Tasks generally range between 2 and 4 digits while
Job numbers range from 4 to 8 digits. The number of Departments, Jobs,
or Tasks to be tracked can be used to determine item number length requirements.
for example a one digit Department number has a maximum of ten values.
(0 to 9) It would not be possible to track 12 departments with a one digit
department number as the department number must be unique. Future growth
should also be accounted for when designing a numbering system. A company
with 8 departments would do well to use a two digit department number
to allow for a maximum of 100 departments. (0 to 99)

3.) List all active Departments, Jobs, and
Tasks and assign each an Item Number with the chosen length. Refer to
this list when configuring Departments, Jobs, and Tasks within InfiniTime. Ensure each item has a
unique item number. Note: All Department Numbers, Job Numbers, and Task
Numbers must be unique though they are independent of each other. For
example a Department, Job, and Task with an item number of 10 can be created.
In this example the Department Number, Job Number, and Task Number would
simply all be set to 10.

Example Item List: ABC
Carpentry & Contractors

| Item | Type | Item Number |
| Construction | Department | 10 |
| Electrical | Department | 20 |
| Philly Mae Pizzeria | Job | 10000 |
| Suzzies Pizzeria | Job | 10001 |
| Framing | Task | 1001 |
| Drywall | Task | 1002 |
| Wiring | Task | 2010 |
| Engineering | Task | 2011 |

The above example shows a subset of all Tasks,
Departments, and Customers currently active at ABC Carpentry & Contractors.
From the examples the chosen item number lengths are evident:

Department Numbers - 2 Digits

Job Numbers - Â 5 Digits

Task Numbers - 4 Digits

A pattern also exists in the Task Numbers
for readability and ease of use. This is an optional design concept which
may be useful in some organizations. ABC Carpentry and Contractors employees
a variety of employees from Electrical Engineers and Contractors to Carpenters.
Some tasks are specific to a particular department and include the department
number inside of the task number to show this relationship. IE: Wiring,
#2010 is related to the Electrical Department #20. Overall,
the most important idea when designing a numbering system for Departments,
Jobs, and Tasks is to ensure numbering remains consistent. Â 

Item Lookup, the third method for transferring
between Departments, Jobs, and Tasks, is only available within the InfiniTime
Employee and Punch Modules. Employees can type the first few letters of
the Department, Job, or Task name and the remaining characters will be
automatically filled. They also have the option of using the Lookup Tool
which displays all available Departments, Jobs, or Tasks in a searchable
list.

| Data Collection Terminal | Supported Labor Transfer Method |
| Athena | Item List |
| Juno | Item List |
| Luna | Item List |
| Scout | Transfer by Item Number |
| Thor | Transfer by Item Number |
| Zephyr | Item List |
| InfiniTime Employee & Punch Modules | Item Lookup |

Note: Allow PC Punch Labor Switching must
be checked before employees will be able to choose their Department, Task,
or Job from the InfiniTime
Employee & Punch Modules

### Job Costing Configuration

For information regarding what types of
information can be entered into Departments, Jobs, and Tasks for Job Costing
purposes please refer to the [Job
Costing Introduction](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Job_Costing_Introduction.md). Remember any combination of Internal Departments,
Jobs / Customers, and Tasks can generally be used within these areas of
InfiniTime.

### Configuring Departments - Introduction

Departments within InfiniTime
are used as the first Job Costing Level. It should be noted that departments
are a required field within the application and as such all employee activity
will be associated with a Department. It is important to keep this information
in mind when using Departments for Job Costing purposes. Since all employee
activity will be associated with a Department steps should be taken to
ensure InfiniTime Departments
correspond to the highest level of Job Costing information.

For example many office companies consider
Internal Departments the highest Job Costing Level in order to ensure
all employee activity is related to a specific category of work such as
Payroll, Shipping, Technical Support, and Programming. Manufacturing may
prefer to use Customers or Job Numbers as the highest level in order to
ensure all employee activity is related to a Customer or Job.

To Configure Departments within InfiniTime for use with Job Costing:

1.) Identify the type of information which
will be tracked in InfiniTime
Departments.

2.) It often helps to create a list all current
items under the chosen type of information. For example if Job Numbers
are to be used as the first Job Costing Level list all current Job Numbers
and any related information. Depending on the information being tracked
within InfiniTime the list
should contain the following:

| Information Type | Department Description Field | Department Cost Center Field | Department Number Field |
| Internal Departments | Department Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Department Number |
| Customers / Jobs | Customer or Job Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Customer / Job Number |
| Tasks | Task Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Task Number |

3.) Create one department for each listed
item. Ensure the Cost Center and Department Numbers are configured appropriately.

### Department Table

![](images_2/SoftwareOverview_001_Btn2_Department.png)

The Department Table displays a list of all Departments configured in
the software. Departments are used to separate employee hours performed
under different disciplines and / or types of activity. Employees can
punch into and out of departments in order to track hours worked under
separate departments such as Programming, Technical Support, or Shipping
or separate tasks such as Welding, Painting, or Finish Work. Initially,
it is important to understand the following concepts regarding InfiniTime Departments and Job Costing:

* InfiniTime includes
  four default departments as shown in the image below. If desired these
  departments can be removed. It should be noted that InfiniTime will only permit a department
  to be deleted if the department 1.) Â Is not assigned to any employees.
  2.) Is not assigned to any timecard records.
* The default department is highlighted blue in the department table.
  When a new employee is inserted they are automatically assigned the
  default department.
* There is no limit to the number of departments that can be inserted
  into the software.
* Job Costing permits customers to track employee hours under various
  levels. Job costing is generally utilized in organizations where employee
  labor costs are of special interest when compared to the cost of finished
  goods such as manufacturing related organizations or where hours are
  billable to clients.

![](images_2/Department-Table.gif)

Insert
- Clicking the Insert button opens the Department Update Form to create
a new department. Add as many departments as needed.

Change
- Displays the Department Update Form for the selected the Department.
The InfiniTime Administrator
may then make changes as desired.

Delete
- Clicking the Delete button will remove the highlighted department from
the list.

### Department Update Form - General Tab

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_023.png)

Department - Enter the given
name of a department within the organization.

Cost Center - Some Accounting
Packages and Payroll Services require this field in order to import InfiniTime data. Â If it is not
required, this field may be left blank. Your Inception Technologies
Implementation Specialist can help you determine if the Department Cost
Center field is required for any specific payroll export. Using the same
cost center for multiple departments will cause activity from both departments
to be lumped together into a single cost center or pay code when the activity
is exported to payroll.

Department Number - Assign a
department number as an additional identifier for Departments. Â No
two departments may have the same department number.

Inactive - Selecting this check
box will cause the department not to appear as a selection in InfiniTime nor will any hours worked
within this department show up on reports.

Default - Â InfiniTime permits one department
to be set as the Default Department. The default department will automatically
be assigned to new employees when they are created..

### Default Schedule Tab

The default schedule within a department record is used to enter a schedule
that is used for all employees assigned to the department. It is important
to note that this schedule is not required, but may be used for scheduling
purposes and is subject to the schedule hierarchy. Schedule entries assigned
to employees take precedence over each other depending on their place
in the schedule hierarchy as outlined below. The hierarchy is arranged
by schedule priority from top to bottom.

* Schedule GANNT Chart
* Employee Default Schedule
* Shifts Assigned to an Employee
* Department Default Schedule
* Policy Default Schedule

For example, the default schedule defined on an employeeÃ¢ÂÂs policy would
be ignored if a default schedule was configured for the employee in their
employee or department record.

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_024.png)

Quick Schedule - Opens the Quick
Default Schedule Tool which permits InfiniTime
Administrators to define a default schedule for all employees assigned
to the respective department. [Additional
details on use of the Quick Default Schedule Tool can be found in the
Scheduling Section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Scheduling/Scheduling.md#sch19b_context_Quick_Default_Schedule) of this document.

### Telephone Punch Options Tab

The Telephone Punch Options Tab of the Department Update Form permits
entry of specific phone numbers which are permitted to perform a Department
Transfer into the respective department. In this way, the InfiniTime Administrator can control
which departments employees are permitted to transfer to. This feature
is especially useful for organizations who use Department Pay Premiums.
The Telephone Punch Options tab will only be displayed on the Department
Update Form if the customer's InfiniTime
Software License includes the Telephone Punch Module.

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_027.png)

Insert -
Opens the Department Valid Telephone Number Update Form which can be used
to add individual Valid Telephone Numbers to the Department Update Form.
Valid Telephone Numbers should be entered in a 10 digit format including
the area code without dashes.

Change -
Opens the Department Valid Telephone Number Update Form for the selected
Valid Telephone Number. The InfiniTime
Administrator may then make changes to the Valid Telephone Number as desired.

Delete -
Deletes the selected Valid Telephone Number from the Valid Telephone Number
Tab. Keep in mind, employees will be permitted to transfer to the respective
department only if the phone number they are calling from is present in
the list.

Note: If no Valid Telephone Numbers are defined
for a given department, employees may transfer to the department from
any telephone number.

### Pay Premiums Tab

Premium Pay makes it possible to define
Premiums, or bonuses in the form of an increased wage. Department premiums
are paid when employees work in a given department which has premiums
configured. Premiums can be configured separately for the Regular, Overtime
One, Overtime Two, Overtime Three, and Overtime Four hour types. This
flexibility makes it possible to meet the needs of a variety of special
payment premiums. Refer to the [Pay
Premium Introduction](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Pay_Premium_Introduction.md) section of this document for more information
on how Pay Premiums are calculated and how to configure them.

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_025.png)

### Hours Mapping Tab

Hours Mapping permits employee hours worked
in a given hours type to be mapped to a different hours type based on
specific conditions such as:

* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Department
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Job
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Task
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Other Activity Type
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Department
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Job
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Task
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Other Activity Type

The Hours Mapping Tab of the Department
Update Form defines Hours Mapping settings for the respective department.
Hours mapping settings configured for a department will be applied to
employee scheduled and unscheduled hours. Â Hours Mapping is considered
an advanced feature and is only required by approximately 30% of production
InfiniTime Installations.
Organizations with Labor Unions and specific hours costing or pay premium
rules for scheduled vs unscheduled hours often find Hours Mapping to be
required. Additional details on configuring and utilizing Hours Mapping
can be found in the [Hours Mapping
Section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hm1_Hours_Mapping) of this document.

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_026.png)

Configuring
Jobs - Introduction

Jobs within InfiniTime
are used as the second Job Costing Level. Jobs commonly relate to individual
Jobs or Invoices under which tasks are performed though they may also
be used for other types of information.

To Configure Jobs within
InfiniTime for use with
Job Costing:

1.) Identify the type of information which
will be tracked in InfiniTime
Jobs.

2.) It often helps to create a list all current
items under the chosen type of information. For example if customers are
to be used as the second Job Costing Level list all current customers
and any related information. Depending on the information being tracked
within InfiniTime the list
should contain the following:

| Information Type | Job Description Field | Job Cost Center Field | Job Number Field |
| Internal Departments | Department Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Department Number |
| Customers / Jobs | Customer or Job Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Customer / Job Number |
| Tasks | Task Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Task Number |

3.) Create one job for each listed item.
Ensure the Cost Center and Department Numbers are configured appropriately.

### Activity Job Table

The Activity Job Table displays a list of all jobs configured in the
software. Jobs are used alongside InfiniTime
Departments to further categorize employee hours for job costing purposes.
Employees can punch into and out of jobs in order to track hours worked
for separate Jobs such as Philly Mae Pizzeria, Jose's Sandwich Shop, etc.
Initially, it is important to understand the following concepts regarding
InfiniTime Departments
and Job Costing:

* Job Costing permits customers to track employee hours under various
  levels. Job costing is generally utilized in organizations where employee
  labor costs are of special interest when compared to the cost of finished
  goods such as manufacturing related organizations or where hours are
  billable to clients.

list.

### Activity Job Â Update Form - General Tab

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_029.png)

Description - Enter the given
name of a Job within the organization.

Cost Center - Some Accounting
Packages and Payroll Services require this field in order to import InfiniTime data. Â If it is not
required, this field may be left blank. Your Inception Technologies
Implementation Specialist can help you determine if the Job Cost Center
field is required for any specific payroll export. Using the same cost
center for multiple jobs will cause employee hours from all jobs with
the same Job Cost Center to be lumped together into a single cost center
when the hours are exported to payroll.

Job Number - Assign a job number
as an additional identifier for jobs. Â No two jobs may have the same
job number.

Inactive - Selecting this check
box will cause the job not to appear as a selection in InfiniTime. Additionally, Inactive
Jobs will not be sent to hardware terminals. Employees will no longer
be able to transfer into or out of inactive jobs.

### Pay Premiums Tab

Premium Pay makes it possible to define
Premiums, or bonuses in the form of an increased wage. Job pay Â premiums
are paid when employees work in a given job which has premiums configured.
Premiums can be configured separately for the Regular, Overtime One, Overtime
Two, Overtime Three, and Overtime Four hour types. This flexibility makes
it possible to meet the needs of a variety of special payment premiums.

Mapping Section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hm1_Hours_Mapping) of this document.

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_031.png)

Configuring
Tasks - Introduction

Tasks within InfiniTime
are used as the third Job Costing Level. It should be noted that Jobs
must exist within the InfiniTimeSoftware
before Tasks can be configured. Attempting to insert a Task before configuring
at least one job will result in a warning. At least one Job must be created
before Tasks can be created. Tasks are the lowest Job Costing Level available
in the InfiniTime software
and are generally used to track various activities performed by employees
though they may also be used for other types of information.

To Configure Tasks within
InfiniTime for use with
Job Costing:

1.) Identify the type of information which
will be tracked in InfiniTime
Tasks.

2.) It often helps to create a list all current
items under the chosen type of information. For example if employees perform
ten tasks on a regular basis for any given task then list all current
tasks and any related information. Depending on the information being
tracked within InfiniTime
the list should contain the following:

| Information Type | Task Description Field | Task Cost Center Field | Task Number Field |
| Internal Departments | Department Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Department Number |
| Customers / Jobs | Customer or Job Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Customer / Job Number |
| Tasks | Task Name | Alphanumeric Code or other Payroll Identifier | Task Number |

3.) Create one task for each listed item.
Ensure the Cost Center and Department Numbers are configured appropriately.

### Activity Task Table

The Activity Task Table displays a list of all tasks configured in the
software. Tasks are used alongside InfiniTime
Departments and InfiniTime
Jobs to further categorize employee hours for job costing purposes. Employees
can punch into and out of activity tasks in order to track hours worked
for separate tasks such as Framing, Painting, Sanding etc. Initially,
it is important to understand the following concepts regarding InfiniTime Tasks and Job Costing:

* Job Costing permits customers to track employee hours under various
  levels. Job costing is generally utilized in organizations where employee
  labor costs are of special interest when compared to the cost of finished
  goods such as manufacturing related organizations or where hours are
  billable to clients.

list.

### Activity Task Â Update Form - General Tab

![](images_2/EmployeeProfile_033.png)

Description - Enter the given
name of a Task within the organization.

Cost Center - Some Accounting
Packages and Payroll Services require this field in order to import InfiniTime data. Â If it is not
required, this field may be left blank. Your Inception Technologies
Implementation Specialist can help you determine if the Task Cost Center
field is required for any specific payroll export. Using the same cost
center for multiple tasks will cause employee hours from all tasks with
the same Task Cost Center to be lumped together into a single cost center
when the hours are exported to payroll.

Task Number - Assign a task
number as an additional identifier for jobs. Â No two tasks may have
the same job number.

Inactive - Selecting this check
box will cause the task not to appear as a selection in InfiniTime. Additionally, Inactive
Tasks will not be sent to hardware terminals. Employees will no longer
be able to transfer into or out of inactive tasks.

### Pay Premiums Tab

Premium
Pay makes it possible to define Premiums, or bonuses in the form of an
increased wage. Task pay Â premiums are paid when employees work in
a given task which has premiums configured. Premiums can be configured
separately for the Regular, Overtime One, Overtime Two, Overtime Three,
and Overtime Four hour types. This flexibility makes it possible to meet
the needs of a variety of special payment premiums. Refer to the [Pay
Premium Introduction](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Pay_Premium_Introduction.md) section of this document for more information
on how Pay Premiums are calculated and how to configure them.

Employee
Job Costing Settings

Employee's can be assigned to a Default Department,
Job, and Task. In this way employee activity will be automatically associated
with a specific Department, Job, and/or Task when they punch in. Employees
can also use the Transfer Button or the Employee and Punch Modules to
switch between Departments, Jobs and Tasks throughout the day. The transfer
button varies in location and use for each hardware terminal. Please refer
to the appropriate manual for your Hardware Device in the Hardware section
of this document for additional information.

To Assign a Default Department, Job, or Task
to an employee:

4.) Select the Department, Job, or Task you
would like to assign as the employee's default. It should be noted the
Job and Task fields will not be displayed until at least one Job or Task
is configured within InfiniTime.
This simplifies the display of the Settings Tab for companies who do not
utilize Job Costing.

![](images_2/JobCosting_Config_14.gif)

Note: Only the Default Department is required.
Â The Default Job and Default Task fields are not required as some
companies may not wish all employees to have their activity associated
with a Job or Task by default. In this way Office workers who simply work
in a department.

Displaying
Job Costing information within the Company and Employee Specific Timecard
Tables

Job Costing is disabled
by default within the InfiniTime
Application. As such Job Costing related fields such as Task and Job must
be added to the grid in the Company Timecard Table and Employee Specific
Timecard Table. It is only necessary to configure these settings once.
The software will save any alterations made to the grid. It should be
noted the grid configuration is a global setting which effects all users.
Additional information on Grid Configuration can be found in the [Customizing
InfiniTime](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/SoftwareOverview/Modules/User_Interface/FormCompletion/Customizable_Table_Display__The_InfiniTime_Grid.md) section of this document.

To add the Task and Job
Fields to the Company Timecard Table:

1.) Click on the Timecard Button in the main
toolbar to open the Company Timecard Table

### Job Costing - Data Collection

InfiniTime supports multiple
sources for Employee Job Costing Activity. When choosing a time source
for Employee Job Costing Activity it is important to understand any restrictions
and configuration options associated with the solution in order to make
the most of InfiniTime's
Job Costing System. Each supported source and its Job Costing Properties
are listed below.

### PC Punch: InfiniTime Employee and Punch Modules

Supported Levels - From
1 to 3 Levels

The InfiniTime
Employee and Punch Modules support all three available Job Costing levels:
Departments, Jobs, and Tasks.

Benefits

Omnipresence: The InfiniTime Employee and Punch Modules
are available from anywhere the InfiniTime
Application can be accessed. Employees can clock in and out for different
Departments, Jobs, and Tasks from any computer with access to the InfiniTime
application using their Login ID and Password. If the InfiniTime
Software has been published to the Internet employees can access the software
worldwide from any computer with internet access using their login credentials.

Customization:
Through use of security roles and configuration the Employee and Punch
Modules can be customized to permit or deny employees the ability to choose
which Department, Job, or Tasks they are working in. In this way employees
can be configured with a default Department and/or Job in such a way that
they are only permitted to change the task they are punching into and
out of.

Optional: The InfiniTime
Employee and Punch Modules can also be made available to employees as
an alternate method for punching in even if hardware terminals such as
the Thor are available. Some companies may wish to disable the ability
to use the InfiniTime Employee
and Punch modules for punching in and out if hardware terminals are available.
This can be accomplished by configuring security for the Employee Punch
Information window and disabling access for the employee security role.
Refer to the [Security
Roles Section of this document](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Security/Security_Overview.md#sec07_Security_Roles) for more information.

### Black & White Terminals: InfiniTime Luna, Â Zephyr, Athena, & Juno

Supported Levels - From
1 to 2 Levels

The Luna, Zephyr, Athena,
and Juno support two of the three available Job Costing levels: Departments
and Jobs.

Benefits

Mobility: Employees can punch in and out
without access to a computer using hardware terminals.

Job Costing: Permits employees to choose
between available Departments and Jobs assigned to the reader when punching
in and out. Employees can also switch between departments and jobs as
needed.

Available Departments & Jobs: A maximum
of 100 Departments and 100 Jobs can be assigned to these readers. In this
way the supervisor can configure multiple departments and jobs within
the InfiniTime Application
and only provide employees with the ability to punch into or out of a
subset of Departments and Jobs. This feature is most suited for manufacturing
or construction environments where specific jobs are performed in the
area where the clock is located.

### Color Terminals: InfiniTime Thor

Supported Levels - From
1 to 3 Levels

The
Thor supports all three available Job Costing levels: Departments, Jobs,
and Tasks.

Benefits

Mobility: Employees can punch in and out
without access to a computer using hardware terminals.

Job Costing: Permits employees to choose
between available Department, Jobs and Tasks assigned to the reader when
punching in and out. Employees can also switch between departments, jobs
and tasks as needed.

Available Departments,
Jobs, and Tasks: A maximum of 100 Departments, 100 Jobs, and 100 tasks
can be assigned to these readers simultaneously. In this way the supervisor
can configure multiple departments, jobs, and tasks within the InfiniTime Application and only provide
employees with the ability to punch into or out of a subset of Departments,
Jobs, and Tasks. This feature is most suited for manufacturing or construction
environments where specific jobs and tasks are performed in the area where
the clock is located.

Intelligent Transfer:
If only a single Department, Job, or Task is assigned to the clock using
the Available Departments, Jobs, or Tasks features the Thor will not ask
for the employee to enter that item when using the Transfer Button. In
this way employees will only be prompted to choose the Task they wish
to work under when using the Transfer Button if a single Department and
Job are assigned to the reader. This concept can be applied to Departments,
Jobs, or Tasks - whereby employees will only have to choose one item be
it Department, Job, or Task when using the Transfer Button.

Alternative Transfer
- If only a single Department, Job, and Task is assigned to the clock
using the Available Departments, Jobs, and Tasks features the Thor will
not prompt the employee to enter their Department, Job, or Task when using
the Transfer Button. The Thor will simply use the single department, job,
and task that have been assigned to the clock. In this way two scenarios
can easily be configured for the clock using the Default Department, Job,
and Task Settings and the Transfer Button. When employees punch in their
activity will automatically be associated with their default Department,
Job, and Task. When using the transfer button their activity will be associated
with the Department, Job, and Task assigned to the Thor through the Available
Departments, Jobs, and Tasks feature.

External Wand: An external
reader can be attached to the Thor which reads barcode badges for the
purpose of Job Costing. InfiniTime
can be configured to parse the number encoded on the badge to find Department,
Job, and Task information. In this way employees can quickly swipe a badge
to transfer between Departments, Jobs, or Tasks.

Transfer By Item Number:
Both the Thor and Scout Terminals support Department, Job, and Task switching
through use of item numbers. Each item has a unique numeric identifier
which is sent to the clock. Employees can enter this unique identifier
in order to select the Department, Job, or Task when punching in. Unique
Identifiers for each Job Costing level are displayed below. Refer to the
[Job Costing
Introduction: Job Transfer](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Job_Costing_Introduction.md#Labor Transfer) section of this document for more information.

### Biometric Terminals: Scout 2000, 3000, and 4000 Terminals

Supported Levels - From
1 to 3 Levels

The Scout Terminals
support all three available Job Costing levels: Departments, Jobs, and
Tasks.

Benefits

Mobility: Employees can punch in and out
without access to a computer using hardware terminals.

Job Costing: Permits employees to choose
between available Department, Jobs and Tasks assigned to the reader when
punching in and out. Employees can also switch between departments, jobs
and tasks as needed.

Available Departments,
Jobs, and Tasks: A maximum of 100 Departments, 100 Jobs, and 100 tasks
can be assigned to these readers simultaneously. In this way the supervisor
can configure multiple departments, jobs, and tasks within the InfiniTime Application and only provide
employees with the ability to punch into or out of a subset of Departments,
Jobs, and Tasks. This feature is most suited for manufacturing or construction
environments where specific jobs and tasks are performed in the area where
the clock is located.

Transfer By Item Number: Both the Thor and
Scout Terminals support Department, Job, and Task switching through use
of item numbers. Each item has a unique numeric identifier which is sent
to the clock. Employees can enter this unique identifier in order to select
the Department, Job, or Task when punching in. Unique Identifiers for
each Job Costing level are displayed below. Refer to the [Job
Costing Introduction: Job Transfer](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Job_Costing_Introduction.md#Labor Transfer) section of this document for more
information.

| Item | Unique Identifier |
| Departments | Department Number |
| Jobs | Job Number |
| Tasks | Task Number |

Note: The hardware terminals and software
modules listed above are the only supported methods for tracking multi-level
Job Costing information. A table listing supported Job Costing Levels
for all InfiniTime Readers
is provided below for quick reference.

| Clock Model | Supported Job Costing Levels | Supported Information Types |
| Apollo SY715 | 1 | Department |
| Athena | 2 | Department, Job |
| Atlas SY777 | 1 | Department |
| Juno | 2 | Department, Job |
| Luna | 2 | Department, Job |
| Omega SY755 | 1 | Department |
| Orion SY760 | 1 | Department |
| Odyssey SY780 | 1 | Department |
| Scout | 3 | Department, Job, Task |
| Thor | 3 | Department, Job, Task |
| Zephyr | 2 | Department, Job |

### Job Costing - Wages

It is not uncommon for employee wages to vary
based upon the task, job, or department, where employees are working.
Wages within InfiniTime
can be allocated to a specific Job, Task, Department, or any combination
thereof. This makes it possible to calculate gross totals based upon which
Department, Job, or Task employees are working in. When using wages with
Job Costing it is important to understand how InfiniTime
identifies which wage to use for an employee. InfiniTime
searches wage records for an employee attempting to match items between
the wage record and where the employee is actively working according to
the wage hierarchy below. Employees will be paid using the wage corresponding
to the first match.

Wage Hierarchy

1.) Department, Job, and Task

2.) Department, Job

3.) Department, Task

4.) Job, Task

5.) Department

6.) Job

7.) Task

For example if an employee worked in the West
Coast Marina Department, Job Number 117852, and the Painting Task InfiniTime would first search for
a wage record matching all three items - West Coast Marina, 117852, and
Painting. If a record was not found for this combination the software
would search for a wage record matching Department and Job which in this
example is West Coast Marina and 117852. If a wage record was not found
for this combination the software would continue down the wage hierarchy
searching for a matching wage record. If no match is found the employee's
default wage is used.

### Wage Configuration

Configuring a Wage for
a specific combination of three items

A wage associated with a specific combination
of Department, Job, and Task will take precedence over all other wages.
For example if wages are configured as shown below the employee will receive
the wage associated with the exact Department, Job, and Task combination
worked by the employee rather than the wage associated with the Task the
employee is working in. Referring to the Wage Hierarchy this occurs because
InfiniTime will match a
wage associated with Department, Job, and Task before a wage associated
with just the Task. Additional examples are below. The highlighted wage
record is the wage the employee will be paid.

Example 1

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| West Coast Marina | 117852 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_1.gif)

Example 2

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| West Coast Marina | 117852 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_2.gif)

The above examples illustrate how employees
will receive the wage associated with the particular Department, Job,
and Task they are working on even if another wage is defined for each
individual item or a combination thereof.

Configuring a Wage for
a specific combination of two items

A wage associated with a specific combination
of two items should be used if employees receive a specific wage when
working under two items such as a specific Department and Task or a specific
Job and Task. For example if an employee receives Â $8 when working
in the West Coast Marina Department and performing the Painting Task regardless
of what Job they are working on a wage should be created and associated
with the West Coast Marina Department and Painting Task as shown below.
Â It is important to keep the Wage Hierarchy in mind when associating
a wage with a combination of two items. In example 2 the employee would
be paid $8 per hour rather than $10 because a wage matching the exact
working Department, Job, and Task is present. This will be matched before
the combination of Department and Task.

Example 1

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| West Coast Marina | 117852 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_3.gif)

Example 2

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| West Coast Marina | 117876 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_4.gif)

The above examples illustrate how the employee
will receive the wage associated with their particular Task and Department
regardless of what job they are working on unless a wage record exists
that matches the Department, Job, and Task worked by the employee.

Configuring a Wage for
a specific item

Wages should be configured for a specific
item such as a Department, Job, or Task when employees have a set wage
for the item. For example, if an employee was paid $10 per hour when painting
regardless of what job or department he was painting under a wage should
be created and associated with the Painting task only as shown below.
In this way it would not matter what department or job the employee was
working under as long as he was performing the painting task he would
receive $10 per hour. It is important to keep the Wage Hierarchy in mind
when associating a wage with a single item. In example 2 the employee
would be paid $8 per hour rather than $10 because a wage matching the
exact working Department, Job, and Task is present.

Example 1

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| Ahbor Harbor | 117852 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_5.gif)

In the example above even though there is
a wage record for each item where the employee is working the Department
record takes precedence as it is matched first due to the Wage Hierarchy.

Example 2

| Working Department (Customer) | Working Job  (Job Number) | Working Task  (Task) |
| West Coast Marina | 117876 | Painting |

![](images_2/JobCostingWages_1.gif)

The above examples illustrate how the employee
will receive the wage associated with a single item unless a different
record is matched due to the Wage Hierarchy as in Example 2.

### Other Activity Types

Other Activity Types permit InfiniTime
administrators to define 'non-working' hours and earning types for items
such as Paid Leave, Unpaid Leave, Tips, Commissions, and Bonuses. InfiniTime provides support for an
unlimited number of Other Activity Types. Other Activity entries can be
entered in hours, currency, or units depending on the requirements and
capabilities of your payroll application. The Other Activity Table, as
shown below, is used to Insert, Modify, and Delete Other Activity Types
within InfiniTime. As part
of the initial configuration of InfiniTime,
one Other Activity Type should be created for each 'non-working' Hours
/ Earning Type tracked by your organization. Examples of typical Other
Activity Types are provided in the [Other
Activity usage section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#ota29_Other_Activity_Types_-_Usage) below.

Accessing
the Other Activity Types Table

* Click on Lookups
* Click on Calculation Setup

![](images_2/ota_(1).gif)

* Click on Other Activity Types

![](images_2/ota_(2).gif)

Insert
Ã¢ÂÂ Inserts a new record into the Other Activity Type Table. Opens the Other
Activity Update Form.

Change
Ã¢ÂÂ Opens the Other Activity Type Update form and permits editing of the
selected record.

Delete
Ã¢ÂÂ Removes the highlighted record from the Other Activity Table.

### Other Activity Update Form

The Other Activity Update Form includes all options and settings related
to Other Activity Types. Each option is outlined below.

![](images_2/OTA_1.png)

Description
Ã¢ÂÂ Type the name of the Other Activity Type.

Type
Ã¢ÂÂ Specify whether the Other Activity Type will track a dollar amount or
hour amount.

Code Number
Ã¢ÂÂ The Code Number is a unique identifier within the InfiniTime
Database. Each other activity type must have a unique code number in order
to set them apart. This code number is used on many hardware terminals
to input other activity directly at the clock without accessing the software.
All hardware terminals offered by Inception Technologies support this
feature except for the Plus Scanner.

Payroll
Mapping Number Ã¢ÂÂ Enter a mapping number. The payroll mapping
number can be the same for multiple other activity types. This number
specifies a column in a payroll export file where hours or amounts for
the other activity type will be totaled. If more than one other activity
type has the same payroll mapping number their values will be added together
and totaled in the same column. Mapped Payroll Interfaces provide the
customer with the ability to add additional other activity types and move
their position within the payroll export on the fly.

The Compupay Ã¢ÂÂ Mapped Interface Format is one such payroll interface.
An outline of the Compupay - Mapped interface format is provided below.
The outline shows a row of headers which represent information that would
be exported when performing a payroll export. The resulting export file
can then be imported directly into the Compupay application. It is important
to understand how Other Activity Types are automatically exported to the
appropriate column according to their Payroll Mapping Number. Other Activity
Types with Payroll Mapping Number 1 will be totaled in the column labeled
Mapped Amount 1. Other Activity Types with Payroll Mapping Number 2 will
be totaled in the column labeled Mapped Amount 2.

| Employee ID | Activity Dept Number | Regular Hours | Overtime Hours | Mapped Amnt. 1 | Mapped Amnt. 2 | Mapped Amnt. 3 |

Payroll
Mapping Codes

Payroll Mapping Codes are agreed upon by
each company and the firm responsible for their payroll. With this in
mind it is not surprising that Payroll Mapping Codes often vary from company
to company. These codes are generally known to payroll personnel or the
company responsible for your payroll. Additional details on the use of
Payroll Codes and Payroll Mapping Codes can be found in the following
sections of this document:

[Payroll
Export User Interface Overview - Payroll Codes Tab](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/PayrollExport/Payroll_Export.md#pxh19_Payroll_Codes_Tab)

[Payroll
Export - Payroll Interface Features & Related Configuration](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/PayrollExport/Payroll_Export.md#pxh42_Payroll_Interface_Features___Related_Configuration)

[Payroll
Interface Layout Report](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Reports/Reports.md#rpt57_Payroll_Interface_Layout)

Regular
Hours Payroll Mapping Code - Enter a Payroll Mapping Code to
be used for Regular Hours and / or Other Hours on the respective Other
Activity Type. Much like the Payroll Mapping Number, the Regular Hours
Payroll Mapping Code can be the same for multiple other activity types,
however it is generally used as a unique code to identify an Hours / Earnings
Type.

OT1
Payroll Mapping Code - Enter a Payroll Mapping Code to be used
for OT1 Hours on the respective Other Activity Type. This field is disabled
unless 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled'
is checked for the respective other activity type. Much like the Payroll
Mapping Number, the OT1 Payroll Mapping Code can be the same for multiple
other activity types, however it is generally used as a unique code to
identify an Hours / Earnings Type.

OT2
Payroll Mapping Code - Â Enter a Payroll Mapping Code to
be used for OT2 Hours on the respective Other Activity Type. This field
is disabled unless 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count as Regular
Hours if Scheduled' is checked for the respective other activity type.
Much like the Payroll Mapping Number, the OT2 Payroll Mapping Code can
be the same for multiple other activity types, however it is generally
used as a unique code to identify an Hours / Earnings Type.

OT3
Payroll Mapping Code - Â Enter a Payroll Mapping Code to
be used for OT3 Hours on the respective Other Activity Type. This field
is disabled unless 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count as Regular
Hours if Scheduled' is checked for the respective other activity type.
Much like the Payroll Mapping Number, the OT3 Payroll Mapping Code can
be the same for multiple other activity types, however it is generally
used as a unique code to identify an Hours / Earnings Type.

OT4
Payroll Mapping Code - Â Enter a Payroll Mapping Code to
be used for OT4 Hours on the respective Other Activity Type. This field
is disabled unless 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count as Regular
Hours if Scheduled' is checked for the respective other activity type.
Much like the Payroll Mapping Number, the OT4 Payroll Mapping Code can
be the same for multiple other activity types, however it is generally
used as a unique code to identify an Hours / Earnings Type.

Common
Payroll Code Examples:

| Other Activity Type | Example Payroll Mapping Codes |
| Holiday Hours | HOL, HOLIDAY |
| Vacation Hours | VAC, VACATION |
| Sick Time Hours | SICK, SIC, SIK |
| Personal Time Hours | PER, PERS, PERSONAL |

Attendance
Review Report Character - Enter a single character to be displayed
on the Attendance Review Report for dates with Hours and / or Other Amounts
for the respective Other Activity Type. Refer to the [Attendance
Review Report section of the Report Library](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Reports/Reports.md#rpt59_Attendance_Review) for additional details.

Count
As Regular Hours - When this option is checked hours entered
under this other activity type will count as regular hours and will be
counted toward both daily, weekly, Day Of Week, and Unscheduled Overtime
as configured within an employee's assigned policy. InfiniTime
Administrators may choose to specifically exclude the respective Other
Activity Type from certain types of Overtime by checking additional options
as outlined below.

Only
Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled - When this option is checked,
hours entered under the respective Other Activity Type will only be counted
as regular hours // totaled toward Daily, Weekly, Day Of Week, and Unscheduled
Overtime on dates which an employee is scheduled. If the respective Other
Activity Type should be inserted on a date where the employee is not scheduled,
the hours will simply be paid as Other Hours under the Regular Hours Payroll
Mapping Code. This concept is illustrated below. Notice how Other Hours
for the Shift Change Other Activity Type are totaled in the regular column
only on 7/30/13 where the employee was scheduled to work.

![](images_2/OTA_4.png)

Count
As Day Worked Ã¢ÂÂ When this check box is checked, the date on
which the respective Other Activity Type is inserted will be counted as
a Worked Day. This option is used for two purposes:

* First, if an Other Activity Type with 'Count as Day Worked' checked
  is inserted on a date with an Absent Exception then the Absent Exception
  will be removed.
* Second, if an Other Activity Type with 'Count as Day Worked' checked
  is inserted on a date immediately prior to or immediately after a
  Holiday Date the 'Employee Must Work Day Before' / 'Employee Must
  Work Day After' Holiday Requirements will be met and InfiniTime will insert the Holiday
  Record according to the Holiday Date Settings.

Count
As Hours Worked for Accrual Calculations - When this option
is checked, Other Activity Hours for the Other Activity Type will be counted
toward the Accrue X Hours for Y Hour(s) Accrual Calculation. This makes
it possible for employees to earn accrual hours based on Worked Hours
(Regular, Overtime 1, Overtime 2, Overtime 3, Overtime 4) and Other Activity
Types such as Vacation, Personal Time, Jury Duty, etc.

Allow
Start Time Entry - When this option
is checked, InfiniTime
will prompt the user to enter the Start Time when inserting Other Hours
for the respective Other Activity Type. In this way, the Other Activity
Hours can be properly mapped according to Unscheduled Hours Mapping rules
and Shift Differential Rules configured on an employee's policy. Allow
Start Time Entry must be checked in order to check 'Apply Shift Differential'
for a given Other Activity Type. Allow Start Time Entry is only available
for Other Activity Types set to 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count
as Regular Hours if Scheduled'.

![](images_2/OTA_6.png)

Use Scheduled
Hours - If this option is checked,
InfiniTime will automatically
set the Other Hours to match the duration of the employee's schedule on
the respective date. When 'Use Scheduled Hours' is enabled, users may
not directly enter or edit the Other Hours for a given date for the respective
Activity Type. Additionally, the respective activity type cannot be inserted
for an employee with no scheduled hours on a given date.

![](images_2/OTA_5.png)

Permit
Entry Only If Scheduled - If this
option is checked, InfiniTime
will only permit the respective Other Activity Type to be inserted on
days where an employee has a Schedule. If an Other Activity Type with
this option is entered via Other Activity Entry from a Hardware Terminal
on a date where an employee does not have a schedule the Other Activity
Entry will be ignored by the InfiniTime
Software during the polling process and the Other Activity Hours will
not be posted to the employee's timecard. The warnings below are displayed
if a user should attempt to insert an Other Activity Type with 'Permit
Entry Only if Scheduled' Checked on a date where an employee is not scheduled.

![](images_2/OTA_7.png)

![](images_2/OTA_8.png)

Apply
Shift Differential - If this option
is checked, Other Hours for the respective Other Activity Type will be
counted toward Shift Differential Hours in accordance with the Shift Differential
Pay Method and Shifts assigned to the employee's policy. 'Apply Shift
Differential' is only available if 'Allow Start Time Entry' and 'Count
as Regular Hours' or Only Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled' are checked.
The example below shows Other Hours for the Other Activity Type Shift
Change applied toward the Day Shift Differential from 8:00 AM to 5:00
PM.

![](images_2/OTA_6.png)

Exclude
From Day Of Week Overtime - If
this option is checked, Hours for the respective Other Activity Type will
not count toward Day of Week Overtime. 'Exclude from Day of Week Overtime'
is only available for Other Activity Types with 'Count as Regular Hours'
or Only Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled' checked. For example, if
an employee were to have Vacation Time, which is set to Count as Regular
Hours, on a Sunday where they would usually get Day of Week Overtime for
worked hours and 'Exclude From Day Of Week Overtime' is checked, the employee
would simply be paid their regular base rate for Vacation Time Hours on
Sundays instead of the Day Of Week Overtime Rate.

Example: Company XYZ Excludes Vacation Time
from Day of Week Overtime. Employees who are normally scheduled to work
on Sunday must use their vacation time to take a day off. Vacation Time
Hours are counted toward Weekly Overtime Hours and as such the Vacation
Time Other Activity Type is set to count as regular hours. However, XYZ
Company only pays Sunday Day Of Week Overtime on worked hours. Benefits
such as Vacation Time are paid at base rate. The screenshots below show
how Exclude from Day Of Week Overtime can be used to properly exclude
Vacation Time from Day of Week Overtime.

Related Settings:

OT1 = Daily > 8 Hours

Sunday Day of Week Regular
Hours -> OT2

Sunday Day of Week OT1
Hours -> OT2

Exclude From Day Of Week
Overtime Unchecked:

![](images_2/OTA_9.png)

With 'Exclude From Day of Week Overtime'
unchecked, hours for an other activity type set to Count as Regular Hours

With 'Exclude From Day of Week Overtime'
unchecked, hours for an other activity type set to Count as Regular Hours
are excluded from Day of Week Overtime Rules. Notice how all hours for
the Shift Change Other Activity Type are paid as Regular Hours even though
they fall on a Sunday. The Configuration for the Shift Change Other Activity
Type in this scenario is shown below.

![](images_2/OTA_11.png)

Exclude
From Unscheduled Overtime - If
this option is checked, Hours for the respective Other Activity Type will
not count toward Unscheduled Overtime. 'Exclude from Unscheduled Overtime'
is only available for Other Activity Types with 'Count as Regular Hours'
or 'Only Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled' checked. For organizations
who track Unscheduled Hours via Unscheduled Hours Mapping settings on
the Schedule Settings / Rules Section of the Policy it is common for most
Other Activity Types, especially Other Activity Types for Paid Time Off
such as Vacation Time or Holiday Pay, to be excluded from Unscheduled
Overtime.

Example: Company XYZ Excludes Holiday Pay
from Unscheduled Overtime. If a Company Observed Holiday Date falls on
a day the employee is not scheduled to work, XYZ Company pays the employee
their base rate for the day. Employees not scheduled to work on a Holiday
Date do not receive Unscheduled Overtime.

this option is checked, Hours for the respective Other Activity Type will
not count toward Daily Overtime. 'Exclude from Daily Overtime' is only
available for Other Activity Types with 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only
Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled' checked.

Example: Company XYZ counts Jury Duty Hours
toward Weekly Overtime but excludes Jury Duty Hours from Daily Overtime.
If an employee is out of the office for Jury Duty, and they report to
work on the same day for a different shift, the employee will not be eligible
for Overtime Unless they work more than 8 hours on the respective date
or if they have worked in excess of 40 Hours for the work week.

beyond the 40 Hours in the Work Week on 8/2/13. The Configuration for
the Shift Change Other Activity Type in this scenario is shown below.

![](images_2/OTA_18.png)

Exclude
From Payroll Export Ã¢ÂÂ Placing a check in this box will allow
the other activity to be excluded from the payroll export. This option
should be checked for any Other Activity Types which are intended for
use within the Time and Attendance System for tracking purposes only.
Other Activity Records on Employee Timecards for Other Activity Types
with this option checked will not be exported by the Payroll Export, though
they will be displayed on reports within InfiniTime.

Inactive
Ã¢ÂÂ Placing a check in this box will make the respective Other Activity
Type Inactive. The respective Other Activity Type will no longer be available
for selection when inserting an Other Activity via Quick Punch, Time Off
Requests, or from Hardware Terminals such as the Thor.

### Hours Mapping Tab

The Hours Mapping Tab of the Other Activity
Update Form is only displayed if 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count
as Regular Hours if Scheduled' are checked for an Other Activity Type.
Hours Mapping permits employee hours worked in a given hours type to be
mapped to a different hours type based on specific conditions such as:

* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Department
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Job
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Task
* Scheduled Hours worked on a specific Other Activity Type
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Department
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Job
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Task
* Unscheduled Hours worked on a specific Other Activity Type

![](images_2/OTA_30.png)

The Hours Mapping Tab of the Other Activity Update Form defines Hours
Mapping settings for the respective Other Activity Type. Hours mapping
settings configured for an Other Activity Type will be applied to scheduled
and unscheduled hours for the respective Other Activity Type. Hours Mapping
is considered an advanced feature and is only required by approximately
30% of production InfiniTime
Installations. Organizations with Labor Unions and specific hours costing
or pay premium rules for scheduled vs unscheduled hours often find Hours
Mapping to be required. Additional details on configuring and utilizing
Hours Mapping can be found in the Hours Mapping Section
of this document.

### Other Activity Types - Usage

Other Activity Types are a highly versatile part of the InfiniTime Time and Attendance application.
Other Activity Types can be configured to meet time and attendance and
Human Resources policies for companies ranging in size with tens of employees
and basic Time and Attendance Requirements to companies with thousands
of employees and complex Union Based Labor Contracts. To meet the diverse
needs of both small business and enterprise customers, InfiniTime offers [several
methods for entering Other Hours and / or Dollar Amounts for specific
Other Activity Types](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#ota30_Method_Of_Entry). Additionally, Other Activity Types can be configured
to track a variety of Hours and Earnings Types for specific [usage purposes](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#ota31_Usage_Purposes).

### Method Of Entry

Other Activity Types are used within InfiniTime
to track Hours and Earnings Types which such as Paid Leave, Unpaid Leave,
Commissions, Bonuses, and Tips. With this in mind, inserting hours and
/ or Dollars for specific Other Activity Types as appropriate to show
the benefits used and / or earned by an employee is an integral part of
the recurring Employee Timecard Review and Editing process. Other Hours
and Other Amount entries can be inserted in multiple ways as outlined
in the table below.

| Method of Entry | Overview |
| Manually via Quick Punch | Other Activity Hours and / or Dollar Amounts can be entered manually using the Quick Punch Feature from the Company Timecard or Employee Timecard. This method is commonly used to insert hours for Other Activity Types whose occurrence cannot be anticipated such as Sick Time or Personal Time. |
| Manually via Approval of a Time Off Request | Other Activity Hours are inserted by InfiniTime upon approval of a Time Off Request sent by an employee. This feature is regularly used by organizations who do one or more of the following:      * Schedule Vacation Time in advance * Use Find Available for Scheduling Purposes * Use Schedule Skeletons for Scheduling Purposes * Use GANNT Chart Scheduling |
| Manually via Function Keys at a Hardware Terminal (IE: Thor, Zephyr, Scout) | Other Activity Hours and / or Dollar Amounts can be entered manually via Function Keys at Hardware Terminals configured to communicate with the InfiniTime Software. This provides a convenient interface for entering Other Activity Hours immediately while at the Job Site and / or Work Area without accessing the InfiniTime Manager Module. |
| Manually via Telephone Punch Menu Prompts using Telephone Punch | Other Activity Hours and / or Dollar Amounts can be entered manually via Telephone Punch Menu Prompts by calling into the Telephone Punch Menu and selecting the appropriate menu options. This provides a convenient interface for entering Other Activity Hours and / or Dollars immediately while in the field without accessing the InfiniTime Manager Module. InfiniTime Telephone Punch is ideal for organizations with a high transaction volume. (IE: Thousands of Employees Punching multiple times per day over a wide geographic area). |
| Automatically via Holiday Dates for a Non-Working Holiday | InfiniTime Holiday Types permit specific Dates to be defined as Holidays. InfiniTime can then automatically insert Other Activity Hours, such as 'Holiday Time', for employees eligible for Paid Holidays. |
| Automatically via Holiday Dates for a Working Holiday | InfiniTime Holiday Types permit specific Dates to be defined as Holidays. For organizations with employees who receive different pay rates for working on a Holiday Date, InfiniTime can be configured to automatically separate and track hours paid at different rates for eligible employees through use of one or more of the following features as appropriate based on your organization's rules:      * Working vs Non Working Holiday Benefits * Other Activity Options: Count As Regular Hours * Other Activity Options: Only Count as Regular Hours if   Scheduled * Holiday Hours Mapping * Unscheduled Hours Mapping * Other Activity Hours Mapping |
| Automatically via Stand By Time | Stand by time is intended for use with on call employees. When Stand By Time is configured on a given policy, Other Hours are automatically inserted for a specific Other Activity Type for each Day Of Week configured for Stand By Time for all employees assigned to the policy. |

### Usage Purposes

InfiniTime permits entry
of both positive and negative values for Other Activity Types making it

### Holiday Types Configuration - Introduction

Holidays make it possible to automatically pay employees
on holidays based upon certain conditions such as requiring the employee
to work the day before or the day after or both in order to receive the
holiday. Similar to the method used for configuring Policies, employee
groups eligible for different holidays must be identified before attempting
to configure holidays within the InfiniTime
Application. The most common reasons for different holiday requirements
include the following:

* Employee
  Pay Type: Salary and Full Time employees generally receive
  pay for all holidays recognized by the company. However Part Time
  employees are generally not eligible for benefits in the form of holiday
  pay. In this scenario two holiday schedule types are required. One
  entitled Ã¢ÂÂEmployee HolidaysÃ¢ÂÂ and another entitled Ã¢ÂÂNo Holiday Benefits.Ã¢ÂÂ
  Salary and Full Time employees would be assigned to the Ã¢ÂÂEmployee
  HolidaysÃ¢ÂÂ Schedule Type where as Part Time Employees would be assigned
  to the Ã¢ÂÂNo Holiday BenefitsÃ¢ÂÂ type.

* Personal
  / Religious Holidays: Some employees may negotiate special
  religious or personal holidays as part of their salary or bonus package.
  A different holiday type will be required for each group or individual
  eligible for different holiday dates. Alternatively, if a holiday
  date is employee specific, the Holiday can be defined within an employee's
  profile. [See the Holidays
  Section of the Employee Profile](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/ovr_SoftwareOverview.md#so177_Holidays_Section) section of this document for additional
  details on how to access the Holiday Section of the Employee Update
  Form to configure employee specific holidays.

All Holiday types configured within the InfiniTime
Software are displayed on the Holiday Schedule Types Table, which can
be accessed from the Lookups Menu as shown below.

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays001.png)

### Holiday Schedule Types Table

The Holiday Schedule Types Table displays a list of all Holiday Types
configured within InfiniTime.
Holiday Types are used to define specific holiday dates for which employees
are eligible for Holiday Pay. Holiday Schedule Types are also used in
conjunction with Employee Policy settings to define specific benefits
for employees who work on holiday dates such as time and a half (1.5x
Employee Base Rate) or double time (2.x Employee Base Rate).

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays002.png)

Insert
- Opens the Holiday Schedule Type Update Form which can be used
to create a new Holiday Type. One Holiday Type should be configured for
each group of employees with different holiday settings. Similar to policies,
the Class System permits multiple holiday types to be created to define
Holiday Settings for employees which receive different holiday benefits
based on the number of years they have been employed with your organization.
For example part time employees generally receive a limited number of
holidays, while full time employees generally receive all federal holidays.
A holiday schedule type would be required for each group of employees,
one for part time and one for full time. If employee holidays should change
based on the amount of time employees have been with the company tenures
must be used. A new holiday schedule type entry is required for each period
with new holiday settings, though each schedule type will use the same
class name because they are in the same group. Employees will automatically
be moved between Holiday Schedule Types in the same class when they meet
tenure requirements. If employee holiday dates do not change based on
the amount of time an individual or group is employed at an organization,
only one Holiday Type must be defined for the respective individual and
/ or group of employees. In this case, the Tenure fields may be left blank

Name Ã¢ÂÂ
A description of the Holiday Schedule Type. Often describes the group
of employees that will be assigned to the holiday schedule type for organizational
purposes and ease of recognition.

Class Ã¢ÂÂ
Classes provide grouping for Holiday Schedule Types. A class can be thought
of as a group name for a particular set of Holiday Schedule Types. The
class name must be identical for all Holiday Schedule Types in a Group.
For clarity, it is recommended that the Class name be configured even
if only one holiday type exists within the database.

Default Class
- When an employee has exhausted all the policies in the class, the employee
will be automatically placed in a different class as specified by the
default class. For clarity, it is recommended that the Default Class name
be configured even if only one holiday type exists within the database.

Employee Tenure
From Amount Ã¢ÂÂ Minimum value, in years, that an employee must work
before qualifying for the Holiday Schedule Type. The Employee Tenure From
Amount can be left blank if only one Holiday Type is required for a group
of employees.

while still qualifying for the Holiday Schedule Type. The Employee Tenure
From Amount can be left blank if only one Holiday Type is required for
a group of employees.

Default Holiday
Schedule Type Ã¢ÂÂ Check this box to make this Holiday Schedule Type
the default. Only one Holiday Schedule Type can be selected as the default,
it will be highlighted as blue in the Holiday Schedule Type Table. Employees are assigned to the Default
Holiday Schedule Type automatically if all of the following conditions
are met:

+ The Employee does not qualify
  for the Holiday Schedule Type that has been assigned due to tenure
  restrictions.
+ The Employee does not qualify
  for any Holiday Schedule Types in the class they are currently
  assigned to.
+ The
  Employee does not qualify for any Holiday Schedule Type in the
  default class they are currently assigned to.

basis. InfiniTime will
prevent the user from changing the holiday date or deleting a holiday
date if a System Holiday Timecard record is present in the database for
the respective holiday date.

used for all Holiday Hours. IE: Holiday Time

All
Worked Hours Are Holiday Pay Determines whether employees will
automatically receive pay for the holiday or if they are required to work
on the holiday before receiving hours. If this option is set to No employees
will automatically receive hours for the holiday if they meet any requirements
defined by other Holiday Options. If this option is set to Yes employees
must punch in and out on the selected date in order to receive holiday
pay.

Other
Activity Hours When All Worked Hours Are Holiday Pay is set to

this field. (IE: 8)

Max
Other Activity Hours When All Worked Hours Are Holiday Pay is set
to Yes employees will not receive holiday pay for hours worked in excess
of the value entered in this field.

Worked
Holiday Rate Multiplier Enter a rate for holiday hours in this
field. Holiday hours will be calculated at this rate for the purpose of
Gross Payroll Reports within the InfiniTime
Application.

Day
Before Holiday Must Be Worked If this option is set to Yes employees
must work the day before the holiday in order to receive holiday hours.
If employees do not have a default schedule defined then Day Before is
literal if the holiday is on a Monday the employee must work the day before
the holiday (Sunday) in order to receive Holiday Hours. If employees have
a default scheduled defined then Day Before refers to the first scheduled
day prior to the holiday.

\*Day
After Holiday Must Be Worked If this option is set to Yes employees
must work the day after the holiday in order to receive holiday hours.
If employees do not have a default schedule defined then Day After is
literal if the holiday is on a Monday the employee must work the day after
the holiday (Tuesday) in order to receive Holiday Hours. If employees
have a default scheduled defined then Day After refers to the first scheduled
day after to the holiday.

\*Note:
The Day Before Holiday Must be Worked and Day After Holiday Must be Worked
settings cannot be enabled for two consecutive holidays such as Thanksgiving
and The Day After Thanksgiving. In this case enable Day Before Holiday
Must be Worked for the first holiday (Thanksgiving) and Day After Holiday
Must be Worked for the second holiday (The Day After Thanksgiving.)

++
\*\*Holiday Starts Day Before
Setting this option to Yes provides the user with the ability to start
holiday pay at a certain time on the day before the holiday. This is commonly
used for night shifts.

++
\*\*Holiday Ends on Holiday
Setting this option to Yes provides the user with the ability to end holiday
pay at a certain time on the day of the holiday.

++
\*\*Holiday Ends Day After
Setting this option to Yes provides the user with the ability to end holiday
pay at a certain time on the day after the holiday.

++ \*\* Holiday Based on Employee's Schedule
- If this option is set to Yes the holiday start and end times will automatically
be adjusted to match the employee's schedule for the date of the holiday.
The employee will then receive Holiday Hours for all hours worked between
the Start and End times of the holiday, as defined by the employee's schedule.
If the employee does not report to work for the holiday date, the employee
will receive Holiday Hours according to the number of working hours scheduled
on the holiday date. Examples are provided below.

Example:
Holiday Based on Employee's Schedule: Employee Reports to Work

Holiday:
Friday, December 24, 2010.

Employee's
Schedule: Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM

In this scenario, the
holiday would start at 8:00 AM and end at 4:00 PM on 12/24/2010. The employee
would receive holiday hours for any hours worked between 8:00 AM and 4:00
PM on 12/24/2010.

Example:
Holiday Based on Employee's Schedule: Employee Has the Day Off and does
not report to work

Holiday:
Friday, December 24, 2010.

Employee's
Schedule: Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM

In this scenario, the
holiday would start at 8:00 AM and end at 4:00 PM on 12/24/2010. Since
the employee did not report to work, they automatically receive Holiday
Pay for 8 Hours.

\*\*Note:
Settings that alter the starting and ending day of the holiday are disabled
when 'All Worked Hours are Holiday Pay is set to No. The start and end
of a holiday can only be altered when employees are required to work the
only in order to receive Holiday Pay.

++Note:
By default, without any changes to settings that alter the starting and
ending day of the holiday, all Hours Between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM on
the date of the holiday will be paid as Holiday Time when 'All Worked
Hours are Holiday Hours' is set to Yes.

Not a Holiday if Worked
- When set to Yes, the Other Activity
Holiday Date will not be inserted if the employee reports to work on the
Holiday date.

.

^^Employee
Required to Work - When set, this option requires employees
to work a minimum number of hours over a specified number of days or weeks
prior to the holiday in order to receive Holiday Pay. Â It is important
to note that the 'Days' and 'Weeks' settings operate differently. The
'Days' selection totals hours over a specified number of days starting
with the day immediately before the date of the holiday. The 'Weeks' selection
totals employee hours worked over a specified number of weeks starting
with the week before the date of the holiday. Refer to the note below
for an illustration of the difference between the 'Day(s)' and 'Week(s)'
selections.

^^Average Hours
Average hours can be set to calculate average hours over a number of days
prior to the holiday or over a number of work weeks prior to the holiday.
It is important to note that the 'Days' and 'Weeks' settings operate differently.
The 'Days' selection averages hours over a specified number of days starting
with the day immediately before the date of the holiday. The 'Weeks' selection
averages employee hours worked over a specified number of weeks starting
with the week before the date of the holiday. Refer to the note below
for an illustration.

^^Note:
The images below illustrate the difference between a 3 Week(s) 21 Day(s).
Days shaded in yellow represent days which will be included in the calculation.
The boxed date indicates the date of the holiday. Notice how the 21 Day
Selection includes the days immediately before the date of the holiday
that fall during the same week of the holiday while the 3 Week Selection
does not.

Example:
Average Hours by Days

![](images_2/21DHOLAVG.jpg)

If Average Hours is
enabled InfiniTime will
average employee working hours for a number of days or weeks prior to
the holiday according to the 'Average the Past' Field and the Days or
Weeks Drop Down Menu. InfiniTime
will then automatically insert the calculated average for the Holiday.
The number of hours entered into the Other Activity Hours field will serve
as the maximum number of hours an employee can receive. Two Examples are
illustrated below with the following settings:

| Average Hours | Yes |
| Days to Average | 21 |
| Other Activity Hours | 10.00 |
| All Hours Worked are Holiday Pay | No |

### Available Holiday Options & Conditions - Hours Mapping Tab

The Hours Mapping Tab permits employee scheduled and unscheduled hours
worked on a Holiday Date to be mapped to a different hours type, such
as Overtime Four. Additional details on the use of Hours Mapping can be
found in the [Hours
Mapping section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hm1_Hours_Mapping) of this document.

Scheduled Hours Tab

Map Regular Hours
Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Scheduled Regular
Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected Hours
Type.

Map OT One Hours
Into - Â When set to a specific hours type, all Scheduled OT
One Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Map OT Two Hours
Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Scheduled OT Two
Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected Hours
Type.

Map OT Three Hours
Into - Â When set to a specific hours type, all Scheduled OT
Three Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Map OT Â Four
Hours Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Scheduled OT
Four Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Scheduled Hours are hours worked which
fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule for a given date. For
example, if an employee has a schedule of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on 4/15/2013,
all Regular Hours, Overtime One Hours, Overtime Two Hours, Overtime Three
Hours, and Overtime Four Hours worked between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM on 12/31/2013
will be considered Scheduled Hours and mapped according to Scheduled Hours
Mapping settings.

Unscheduled Hours Tab

Map Regular Hours
Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Unscheduled Regular
Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected Hours
Type.

Map OT One Hours
Into - Â When set to a specific hours type, all Unscheduled
OT One Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Map OT Two Hours
Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Unscheduled OT Two
Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected Hours
Type.

Map OT Three Hours
Into - Â When set to a specific hours type, all Unscheduled
OT Three Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Map OT Â Four
Hours Into - When set to a specific hours type, all Unscheduled
OT Four Hours worked on the Holiday Date will be mapped into the selected
Hours Type.

Unscheduled Hours are hours worked
which fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule for a given date.
For example, if an employee has a schedule of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on 12/31/2013,
all Regular Hours, Overtime One Hours, Overtime Two Hours, Overtime Three
Hours, and Overtime Four Hours worked outside of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on
12/31/2013 (IE: 12/31/2013 12:00 AM - 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 11:59 PM)
will be considered Unscheduled Hours and mapped according to Scheduled
Hours Mapping settings.

Any Hours Worked
Over Holiday Hours go Into OT - Allows you to map hours worked
in excess of the Holiday Other Activity Hours amount to an overtime bucket.

Deduct Worked
Holiday Hours from Weekly Overtime - When checked, Hours Worked
on the Holiday Date will not be counted toward weekly overtime hours.

### Available Holiday Options & Conditions - Rate Mapping Tab

The Rate Mapping Tab of the Master Holiday
Update form permits the InfiniTime
Administrator to scale the number of Other Activity Hours awarded on the
holiday date according to the number of hours worked by the employee over
a number of days prior to the holiday date. This feature is especially
useful for organizations who wish to scale Holiday benefits accordingly
for Part Time and Full Time employees based on the employee's worked hours.

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays006.png)

Days to Rate Map
- Enter the number of days, prior to the holiday date, for
which worked hours will be totaled and compared against Rate Mapping entries
to determine how many Other Activity Hours should be awarded for each
employee assigned to the respective holiday type.

Insert -
Displays the Holiday Rate Mapping Update Form as shown below which is
used to create new rate mapping entries. One Rate Mapping Entry should
be created for each separate Other Activity Amount to be awarded based
on employee working hours. For example, Â the image above shows a
simple Holiday Rate Mapping configuration with a Â break down awarding
two holiday hours for every multiple of ten Â hours worked. ![](images_2/hs11.gif)

Hours Worked:
Â The range of hours that must be worked over the days prior to the
holiday as defined by 'Days to Rate Map' to receive the specified number
of Other Activity Hours.

Other Activity
Hours: The amount of other activity hours given when an employee's
total worked hours falls within the specified range of hours.

Change -
Opens the Master Holiday Update form for the selected Holiday Date. The
InfiniTime Administrator
may then alter the Holiday Options and conditions as desired for the respective
holiday date. It is important to note that the Holiday Date should not
be changed. InfiniTime
Holidays must be configured for each individual date on a year to year
basis. InfiniTime will
prevent the user from changing the holiday date or deleting a holiday
date if a System Holiday Timecard record is present in the database for
the respective holiday date.

Delete -
Deletes the selected Holiday Date from the respective Holiday Type. It
should be noted thatÂ InfiniTime
will prevent the user from deleting a holiday date if a System Holiday
Timecard record is present in the database.

### Holiday Types Configuration - Process Flow

Follow the steps below to
gather required information and configure holidays:

1. Identify employee groups and / or individuals
   eligible for different holidays.
2. Identify any groups and / or individuals
   requiring special consideration. Each group of employees eligible
   for different Holiday Dates and / or special considerations will require
   a different holiday schedule type.\*\*
3. List all holidays for which each group
   and is eligible.
4. List any employee specific holidays (If
   Applicable.)
5. Create a Holiday Schedule Type for each
   group of employees identified in Step 2.
6. Insert Holiday Dates as appropriate for
   each Holiday Schedule Type. Be sure to set the Holiday Features and
   Conditions appropriately for each Holiday Date.

\*\*NOTE: If only a handful of employees are eligible
for specific holidays, as often occurs in the case of some Religious Holidays,
Holiday Dates may be configured on an Employee by Employee Basis within
the Employee's Profile.

Note: Holidays dates do not automatically move
from year to year. Holiday dates records must be created for each individual
holiday date on a yearly basis. Holiday records for prior years should
not be deleted.

Note: Employee holiday eligibility does not commonly
change based upon the amount of time an individual has been with a company,
however classes and tenures can be used to provide support for this scenario.

Note: InfiniTime
7.07 permits multiple Holiday Date Entries for a single Calendar Date.
This makes it possible to configure different Hours Mapping settings for
Worked Hours on a Holiday Date (IE: A Holiday Date with All Worked Hours
are Holiday Hours = Yes) and Holiday Pay Hours awarded even when the employee
does not report to work (IE: A Holiday Date with All Worked Hours are
Holiday Hours = No).

### Holiday Types Configuration - Example Basic Configuration

ABC Company has, on an overall basis, three groups of employees with
distinct holiday settings:

* Full Time Production Employees are eligible for all company observed
  holidays, though they must work the day before and day after in order
  to receive the holiday. Full Time Production Employees who report
  to work on Holiday Dates receive OT2 for all hours worked.

Note: ABC Company Tracks Regular Hours as <40
/ Weekly, OT1 Hours as >40 Weekly and OT2 Hours as Worked Holiday Hours

* Full Time Admin employees are eligible for all company observed
  holidays and are not required to work the day before or day after.
  Full Time Admin Employees are not expected to report to work on Holiday
  Dates.
* Part Time Employees are not eligible for any holidays. Holiday
  Eligibility for Full Time employees does not change based on their
  time with the company.

Additionally, two Full Time employees (Employee ID 202 and 708) observe
specific Religious Holidays. While these Holidays are not observed directly
by ABC Company Ã¢ÂÂ the employeeÃ¢ÂÂs in question have been preapproved for
Personal Time on these dates and ABC Company would prefer if InfiniTime could handle these holidays
automatically. Employees are not required to work the day before or day
after in order to receive their Employee Specific Holidays. Employees
will not report to work on Employee Specific Holidays.

Holidays would be configured as follows for this scenario:

1. Log Into the Manager Module
2. Click on Lookups Ã¢ÂÂ Calculations Setup Ã¢ÂÂ Holiday
   Schedule Types
3. Click Insert to Create a Holiday Type
4. Set the Holiday Type Description, Class,
   Default Class, and Tenure as Appropriate
5. Click on the Dates Tab and Click Insert to
   Create a Holiday Date
6. One Holiday Date must be created for each
   Holiday Observed by ABC Company as listed below. Be sure to configure
   Holiday Features & Conditions as appropriate for each holiday
   date.
7. Employee Specific Holidays can be defined
   on the Employee Update Form:

1. Open the Employee Table
2. Search for the Employee for which the
   Employee Specific Holiday will be defined. Highlight the employee
   and click Change.
3. Click on the Holidays Tab.
4. Click Insert to Create a Holiday Date
   for the respective employee. This Holiday Date will only be created
   for the employee in question. Be sure to configure Holiday Features
   & Conditions as appropriate for each holiday date.

### Holiday Types Configuration - Holiday Configuration for Organizations that Differentiate between Scheduled and Unscheduled Hours

For organizations that differentiate between Scheduled and Unscheduled
Hours, employees may receive different rates of pay for Holiday Dates
depending on whether they were scheduled to work on the Holiday Date.
InfiniTime's flexible Hours
Mapping System, Holiday Options, Other Activity Types, and Payroll Export
System provide support for a variety of configurations to meet the needs
of most organizations. Before we review exactly how to separate Scheduled
and Unscheduled Hours worked on Holiday Dates within InfiniTime,
let us first discuss common incentives and benefits awarded to employees
for Holiday Dates.

| Method | Description |
| Fixed Benefits | Employees receive a preset number of hours at a specific pay rate for each Holiday Date, based on specific conditions as set on the Holiday Date. |
| Premium Pay for Worked Hours | Employees receive a premium pay rate for worked hours (Scheduled, Unscheduled, or Both) on a Holiday Date. |
| Fixed Benefits with Premium Pay for Worked Hours | Employees receive both a preset number of hours at their base rate for each Holiday Date in addition to a premium |

#### Holiday Configuration - Fixed Benefits

Fixed Benefits, or a preset number of hours paid at a specific pay rate
for each Holiday date, are awarded to employees for each holiday date
based on specific Holiday Options and Conditions set on the Holiday Date.
Fixed Benefits are automatically inserted by InfiniTime
as Other Hours for the Other Activity Type selected on the Holiday Date.
When differentiating between Scheduled and Unscheduled Hours, a fixed
number of scenarios exist for individual employees on a given holiday
date as outlined below. Holiday Options and Conditions can be set to award
or deny Fixed Benefits for specific scenarios as outlined below.

| Schedule Exists on Holiday Date | Working Status | Note |
| Yes | Working | Award:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to award Fixed Benefits only on Holiday Dates where employees   work a minimum number of hours. See ' Employee Required To   Work' below.   Deny:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to deny Fixed Benefits if an employee works on a Holiday Date.   See 'Not a Holiday If Worked' below. |
| Yes | Not Working // Facility Closed | Award:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to award Fixed Benefits on all Holiday Dates regardless of   whether employees work. To award Fixed Benefits in all situations,   'Employee Required to Work' should be blank and 'Not a Holiday   if Worked' should be No. * If the 'Employee Required   To Work' option is used to require employees to work in order   to receive Fixed Benefits, InfiniTime   will not insert Other Hours in this scenario.   Deny:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to deny Fixed Benefits if an employee doesn't work a minimum   number of hours on the holiday date. See 'Employee Required   To Work' below. |
| Yes | Not Working // Employee Called Out Sick | Award:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to award Fixed Benefits on all Holiday Dates regardless of   whether employees work. To award Fixed Benefits in all situations,   'Employee Required to Work' should be blank and 'Not a Holiday   if Worked' should be No.   Deny:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to deny Fixed Benefits if an employee doesn't work a minimum   number of hours on the holiday date. See 'Employee Required   To Work' below. * If employees do not receive   Fixed Benefits on Holidays when they call out sick, [an   Other Activity Entry can be used to offset the Holiday Pay   Hours automatically created by InfiniTime.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#ota33_Other_Hours) |
| No | Working // Employee Called In For Duty | Award:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to award Fixed Benefits only on Holiday Dates where employees   work a minimum number of hours. See ' Employee Required To   Work' below.   Deny:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to deny Fixed Benefits if an employee works on a Holiday Date.   See 'Not a Holiday If Worked' below. |
| No | Not Working | Award:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to award Fixed Benefits on all Holiday Dates regardless of   whether employees work.   Deny:   * Holiday Dates can be configured   to deny Fixed Benefits if an employee doesn't work a minimum   number of hours on the holiday date. |

Fixed
Benefits - Holiday Options and Conditions

To Award Fixed Benefits,
a Holiday Date must be configured with 'All Worked Hours are Holiday Pay'
= No. For each Holiday Date, the Other Activity Hours field should be
set to the number of hours to be awarded to employees. Options and conditions
can be used to limit or adjust the total number of Other Hours awarded
to employees in specific situations as explained below. Additionally,
a single Other Activity Type such as 'Holiday Pay' should be assigned
to each Holiday Date. Pay Codes should be set as appropriate for the 'Holiday
Pay' Other Activity type to ensure the customer's Payroll Application
pays Holiday Pay Hours at the correct rate.

#### Holiday Configuration - Fixed Benefits + Premium Pay for Worked Hours

For organizations that provide for both Fixed Benefits and Premium Pay
Benefits for Worked Hours on Holiday Dates with Scheduled and Unscheduled
Hours, two sets of Holiday Dates must be created for each Calendar Date
with Holiday Benefits. First, for each Calendar Date on which employees
receive Holiday Benefits, configure a Holiday Date as appropriate for
Fixed Benefits. Refer to the above section ['Holiday
Configuration - Fixed Benefits'](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hol12_Holiday_Types_Configuration_-_Holiday_Configuration_for_Organizations_that_Differentiate_between_Scheduled_and_Unscheduled_Hours) for additional details. Â Second,
for each Calendar Date on which employees receive Premium Pay for Worked
Hours, configure a Holiday Date as appropriate for Premium Pay for Worked
Hours. Refer to the above section ['Holiday
Configuration - Premium Pay for Worked Hours'](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hol14_Holiday_Configuration_-_Premium_Pay_for_Worked_Hours) for additional details.
InfiniTime will automatically
award both Fixed Benefits and Premium Pay for Worked Hours based on the
Holiday Options and Conditions set for each individual holiday date. With
this in mind, special care should be taken to configure each individual
holiday date with appropriate Holiday Options and Conditions to match
the needs of your organization.

### Holiday Configuration Procedure - Fixed Benefits and Premium Pay for Worked Hours with Scheduled & Unscheduled Hours

For clarity, an example is provided below showing complete configuration
for a single Calendar Date in order to award both Fixed Benefits and Premium
Pay for Worked Hours. Customers wishing to configure holidays for both
Fixed Benefits and Premium Pay for Worked Hours w/ Scheduled and Unscheduled
hours can follow the procedure below to configure holidays.

Holiday Configuration
Procedure: Fixed Benefits + Premium Pay For Worked Hours w/ Scheduled
& Unscheduled Hours

1. Ensure Employee Policies
   are configured to separate employee worked hours into OT1, OT2, OT3,
   and OT4 as appropriate to meet your organization's needs.
2. List
   each set of Employees Eligible for Holiday Benefits on Different Calendar
   Dates.
3. List
   each Calendar Date for each set of Employees Eligible for Holiday
   Benefits on Different Calendar Dates.
4. Create
   One Holiday Type for each Set of Employees.
5. Create
   One Fixed Benefit Holiday Date for each Calendar Date. Configure Holiday
   Options and Conditions as appropriate to award Fixed Benefits according
   to your organization's Time and Attendance & Labor Policies.
6. Create One Premium Pay For Worked
   Hours Holiday Date for Each Calendar Date. Configure Holiday Options
   and Conditions as appropriate to award Fixed Benefits according to
   your organization's Time and Attendance & Labor Policies.
7. Use
   Quick Assign to assign employees to the appropriate Holiday Type.

### Example Holiday Configuration - XYZ Hospitality Corporation

1.
Ensure Employee Policies are configured to separate employee worked hours
into OT1, OT2, OT3, and OT4 as appropriate to meet your organization's
needs.

XYZ Hospitality has two sets of employees,
Hourly Operations Employees and Salary Administrative Employees. Hourly
Operations Employees receive Daily Overtime after 10 hours in a day. Additionally,
all unscheduled hours are paid at 200% of an employee's pay rate. Salary
Administrative Employees receive Daily Overtime after 8 hours worked in
a day. Additionally, all unscheduled hours on regular working days are
paid at 200% of an employee's base rate. For Holiday Dates, XYZ Hospitality
pays a specific rate for Scheduled Regular Hours (200%), Scheduled Overtime
Hours (250%), Unscheduled Regular Hours (300%), and Unscheduled Overtime
Hours (350%). For this reason, due to the [Hours
Mapping Hierarchy](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#hm19_3._Understand_how_the_Hours_Mapping_Hierarchy_will_affect_your_pay_premium_s_) Unscheduled Regular Hours and Unscheduled Overtime
Hours must be mapped in to separate Overtime buckets as shown below, even
though they are paid at a the same rate on regular working days.

| Policy / Set of Employees | OT1 Hours  (Daily OT) | OT2 Hours   (Unscheduled Regular Hours) | OT3 Hours  (Unscheduled OT1 Hours) | OT4 Hours |
| Hourly Operations Employees | Daily > 10 Hours  Paid at 150% of Base Rate | Unscheduled Regular Hours  Paid at 200% of Base Rate | Unscheduled OT1 Hours  Paid at 200% of Base Rate | N/A |
| Salary Administrative Employees | Daily > 8 Hours  Paid at 150% of Base Rate | Unscheduled Regular Hours  Paid at 200% of Base Rate | Unscheduled OT1 Hours  Paid at 200% of Base Rate | N/A |

2. List
   each set of Employees Eligible for Holiday Benefits on Different Calendar
   Dates.

XYZ Hospitality pays the same Holiday Benefits
for both Hourly Operations Employees and Salary Administrative Employees.
Only a single Holiday Type is required for XYZ Hospitality as shown below.

![](images_2/hol33.png)

3. List
   each Calendar Date for each set of Employees Eligible for Holiday
   Benefits on Different Calendar Dates.

XYZ Hospitality pays both Fixed Benefits
and Premium Pay for Worked Hours for the following holiday dates.

| Calendar Dates - Hourly Operations Employees and Salary Administrative Employees | | | |
| 1/1/2013 | 2/18/13 | 7/4/13 | 11/28/13 |
| 1/21/13 | 2/27/13 | 9/2/13 | 12/25/13 |

4. Create
   One Holiday Type for each Set of Employees

Since all employees at XYZ Hospitality
receive the same Holiday Benefits, only one Holiday Type is required.

| XYZ Hospitality Holiday Types |
|  |

5. Create One Fixed
   Benefit Holiday Date for each Calendar Date. Configure Holiday Options
   and Conditions as appropriate to award Fixed Benefits according to
   your organization's Time and Attendance & Labor Policies.

The table
below shows the Pay Code, Pay Rate, and Other Activity Type configuration
for Fixed Holiday Dates as used by XYZ Hospitality.

| Other Activity Type  & Other Activity Options | Regular Hours | OT1 Hours  (Daily OT) | OT2 Hours   (Unscheduled Regular Hours) | OT3 Hours  (Unscheduled OT1 Hours) | OT4 Hours |
| Holiday Pay  * Count as Regular Hours Not Checked * Count as Day Worked Checked | Paid at Base Rate  Payroll Mapping Code 'HP' | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

An example
of a Fixed Holiday Date is shown below.

![](images_2/hol29.png)

With this
configuration, Fixed Holiday Benefits will be inserted automatically and
manually in the scenarios shown below. Supervisors at XYZ hospitality
will need to insert Fixed Holiday Benefits manually on Scheduled Non Working
Days where the office is closed and employees receive Holiday Benefits.
XYZ Hospitality specifically chose to enable 'Employee Required To Work'
and manually enter Holiday Pay in one scenario in order to ensure employees
would not be accidentally overpaid by automatic Holiday Pay entries. With
this configuration, if supervisors should neglect to insert employee holiday
hours an adjustment can be made to pay additional hours to the employee
during the next pay period.

| Schedule Exists on Holiday Date | Working Status | Fixed Holiday Benefits Awarded? |
| Yes | Working | Yes - Automatically Inserted by Fixed Benefit Holiday - 8 Holiday Pay Hours. Employees must also work the day before and day after the holiday date in order to receive Holiday Pay. |
| Yes | Not Working // Facility Closed | Yes - Manually Inserted by Supervisors - 8 Holiday Pay Hours. Employees who work the day before and day after the holiday date are eligible to receive Holiday Pay. Holiday Pay Hours must be manually inserted by XYZ Hospitality Supervisors in this scenario. InfiniTime will not automatically award Holiday Pay Hours in this scenario because the employee did not work at least 1 hour on the holiday date. |
| Yes | Not Working // Employee Called Out Sick | No - No Supervisor Action Required. Â InfiniTime will not award Holiday Pay Hours in this scenario because the employee did not work at least 1 hour on the holiday date. |
| No | Working // Employee Called In For Duty | Yes - Automatically Inserted by Fixed Benefit Holiday - 8 Holiday Pay Hours. Employees must also work the day before and day after the holiday date in order to receive Holiday Pay. |
| No | Not Working | No - No Supervisor Action Required. Â InfiniTime will not award Holiday Pay Hours in this scenario because the employee did not work at least 1 hour on the holiday date. In this scenario, the holiday date was a Day Off as part of the employee's normal schedule. XYZ Hospitality does not pay Holiday Benefits on Holiday dates where employees do not report to work and are not scheduled to work. |

Notice how
a Fixed Holiday Date is configured for each Calendar Date on which employees
at XYZ Hospitality receive Holiday benefits as shown below.

![](images_2/hol30.png)

6. Create
   One Premium Pay For Worked Hours Holiday Date for Each Calendar Date.
   Configure Holiday Options and Conditions as appropriate to award Premium
   Pay for Worked Hours Benefits according to your organization's Time
   and Attendance & Labor Policies.

The table below shows the Pay Code,
Pay Rate, and Other Activity Type configuration for Premium Pay for Worked
Hours Holiday Dates as used by XYZ Hospitality.

| Other Activity Type  & Other Activity Options | Regular Hours | OT1 Hours  (Daily OT) | OT2 Hours   (Unscheduled Regular Hours) | OT3 Hours  (Unscheduled OT1 Hours) | OT4 Hours |
| Holiday Worked  * Count as Regular Hours Checked * Count as Day Worked Checked | * Scheduled Regular Hours on a Holiday Date * Paid at 200% Base Rate * Payroll Mapping Code 'HW' | * Scheduled Overtime Hours on a Holiday Date (Daily >   8 / > 10 Depending on Employee Policy) * Paid at 250% Base Rate * Payroll Mapping Code 'HWOT' | * Unscheduled Regular Hours on a Holiday Date * Paid at 300% Base Rate * Payroll Mapping Code 'HWUH' | * Unscheduled OT1 Hours on a Holiday Date * Paid at 350% Base Rate * Payroll Mapping Code 'HWUO' | * N/A |

An example
of a Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Date is shown below.

![](images_2/hol31.png)

With this
configuration, Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Benefits will tracked
automatically in the scenarios shown below.

| Schedule Exists on Holiday Date | Working Status | Fixed Holiday Benefits Awarded? |
| Yes | Working | Yes - Worked Hours are automatically posted to the Holiday Worked Other Activity Type and separated according to hours type. Employees must also work the day before and day after the holiday date in order to receive Holiday Pay. |
| Yes | Not Working // Facility Closed | No - No Supervisor Action Required. Â InfiniTime will not award Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Benefits in this scenario because the employee did not work. |
| Yes | Not Working // Employee Called Out Sick | No - No Supervisor Action Required. Â InfiniTime will not award Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Benefits in this scenario because the employee did not work. |
| No | Working // Employee Called In For Duty | Yes - Worked Hours are automatically posted to the Holiday Worked Other Activity Type and separated according to hours type. Employees must also work the day before and day after the holiday date in order to receive Holiday Pay. |
| No | Not Working | No - No Supervisor Action Required. Â InfiniTime will not award Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Benefits in this scenario because the employee did not work. |

Notice how
a Premium Pay for Worked Hours Holiday Date is configured for each Calendar
Date on which employees at XYZ Hospitality receive Holiday benefits as
shown below.

![](images_2/hol32.png)

7.
Use Quick Assign to assign employees to the appropriate Holiday Type.

Refer to
the Quick Assign and Employee Filter sections of this document for complete
instructions on use of Quick Assign.

![](images_2/hol34.png)

# Groups Introduction

InfiniTime Groups make
it possible to organize employees into different organization units such
as by building, by sub department or position, by floor, by city or by
state. This is accomplished by first creating a group level for each organizational
unit and then creating a group description for each possible value for
the respective organizational unit. Â In this way, employees can then
be assigned to a specific group description for each group level. There
is no limit to the number of groups that may be configured within InfiniTime. When configuring groups
one group description per group level must be set as the default. The
default group description will automatically be assigned to all employees
for each group level. For additional information on using groups with
security filters and the default group function refer to the [Security
Filters Section of this document](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Security/Security_Overview.md#gro_Selected_Groups).

It is important to understand that employees cannot belong to two groups
within the same group level. For example, the image below shows two group
levels, Location and Division. An employee may belong to any one location
and any one division, but they cannot belong to two divisions.

![](images_2/Groups01.gif)

Accessing
Groups

* Click on Lookups
* Click on Employee Setup
* Click on Groups

![](images_2/CH3_CompInfo3.gif)

### Group Table

The Group Table displays all Group Levels and Group Descriptions configured
within InfiniTime. When
configuring groups, it is important to note that the Insert and Change
Buttons on the Group Table are context sensitive. If a Group Level is
selected, the Insert Button will open the Group Level Update form which
can be used to create a new Group Level. If a Group Description is selected,
the Insert Button will open the Group Update Form which can be used to
create a new Group Description for the respective Group Level. When a
Group Level is first created, 'None' will be displayed when the Group
Level is expanded. To insert the first group description for a Group Level,
expand the Group Level, Â select the entry titled 'None', then click
Insert to open the Group Update Form. Additional details on how to assign
groups to employees can be found in the [Employee
Update Form Settings Tab](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/ovr_SoftwareOverview.md#so167_Settings_Tab_-_Groups) and [Quick
Assign](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#qa04_Using_Quick_Assign) Sections of this document.

![](images_2/Groups01.gif)

Insert - Opens the Group Level
Update Form or the Group Update Form depending on the item selected on
the Group Table. As detailed above, If a Group Level is selected, the
Insert Button will open the Group Level Update form which can be used
to create a new Group Level. If a Group Description is selected, the Insert
Button will open the Group Update Form which can be used to create a new
Group Description for the respective Group Level.

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays008.png)

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays009.png)

Change - Opens the Group Update
Form or Group Level Update Form as appropriate for the selected item.
The InfiniTime Administrator
may then alter the Group Level or Group Description as desired.

Delete - Deletes the selected
Group Description or Group Level from the Group Table. All employees assigned
to a Group Description that is deleted will be assigned to the Default
Group Description for the respective group level.

# Quick Assign Introduction

InfiniTime provides a
unique and powerful interface tool that can be used to configure and assign
basic settings to multiple employees, as specified using the Employee
Filter. In this way InfiniTime
Administrators can quickly assign policies, holiday types, shifts, etc
to ten, twenty, or even hundreds of employees. Before attempting to use
Quick Assign users should be familiar with use and operation of the Employee
Filter. Refer to the [Security
section of this document](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Security/Security_Overview.md#sec16_Security_Filters) for more information on the Employee Filter
before continuing. It is important to note that Quick Assign requires
a specific filter to be set, even if the user wishes to perform a given
quick assign action for all employees. The warning below will be displayed
if a filter is not set and the user attempts to Click OK on the Quick
Assign Update Form.

Accessing
Quick Assign:

* Click on Tools

![](images_2/AccessQA.jpg)

* Click on Quick Assign. The Quick Assign History window will be
  displayed as shown below.

### Quick Assign History Table

The Quick Assign History Table displays a history of all Quick Assign
Actions performed. These actions can be undone by clicking on the Undo
Button. This helps prevent time consuming troubleshooting in the event
of a mistake while using Quick Assign. For example, if you were to assign
a policy to all of the employees in a specific department and later notice
that you assigned the wrong policy, the Quick Assign History window can
be used to undo those changes.

![](images_2/Conf_Holidays013.png)

Undo -
Reverts all employees affected by the selected Quick Assign Action to
their original settings. To use the Undo Feature, select the Quick Assign
action you wish to Undo, then click on the Undo Button.

Technical Note: The Undo Feature takes a snapshot
of current settings. Using the Undo Button simply instructs the software
to restore the settings that were saved in this snapshot. The snapshot
is taken before the changes specified by the quick assign are applied.
It is important to note that any manual changes made after the Quick Assign
will be lost. For example, lets say all of the employees in your company
are on the their respective departments. Employees are split amongst the
following departments: Shipping, Sales, Technical Support, and Programming,
Trainees. A quick assign is used to move a group of employees from the
Trainees department into the Technical Support Department. The department
for Jacque, one of the former trainees, is then manually changed to Sales.
If undo were used at this point all of the employees that were moved from
the Trainees Department to the Technical Support Department, including
Jacque, would be reset to the Technical Support Department. The manual
change made to Jacque's department is lost.

View -
Displays the Quick Assign Update Form populated with details of the selected
Quick Assign Action. View is often useful for reviewing Quick Assign Actions
prior to utilizing the Undo Feature.

Insert -
Opens the Quick Assign Update Form. The InfiniTime
System Administrator may then set specific settings and options and select
specific employees to assign the settings to. The Quick Assign too.l

Delete -
Deletes the Selected Quick Assign Action from the Quick Assign Table.
It is important to note that once a Quick Assign Action is deleted, it
will no longer be possible to undo the Quick Assign Action using the Undo
Feature.

### Using Quick Assign

Click insert on the Quick Assign Table to open the Quick Assign Update
Form as shown below. The Quick Assign Tool allows users to assign items
from departments to schedules for multiple employees at the same time.
Quick Assign will assign all specified items to employees that have been
selected with the Employee Filter, which can be accessed from the bottom
of the Quick Assign window. Be sure to verify that only the employees
whom you wish to configure are selected. There are a few general steps
which must be followed in order to successfully perform a Quick Assign
Action:

1. Enter a description for the Quick Assign Action. This description
will be displayed in the Quick Assign History Table and should describe

### Hours Mapping

Hours mapping permits either scheduled or unscheduled hours for specific
worked hours types (IE: Regular, OT1, OT2, OT3, OT4) to be separated into
a different column on employee timecards. This functionality provides
the InfiniTime Administrator
with complete control over:

* Which
  Hours Type Scheduled and / or Unscheduled Hours are totaled under
  on Employee Timecards and Timecard Reports (IE: Regular, OT1, OT2,
  OT3, OT4)
* The pay
  rate employee hours are paid at
* The payroll
  code exported for employee hours

Hours Mapping can be enabled for a variety of conditions, as outlined
in the table below. This flexibility, along with existing Job Costing
Functionality, allows Hours Mapping Rules to be applied based on Job Costing
Categories selected by employees at the time of punch or specifically
entered by supervisors during the review and editing of employee timecards.
In this way, hours mapping can be used to meet the needs of a variety
of special payment scenarios. Hours Mapping is an optional feature and
is intended for use by organizations that differentiate between Scheduled
and Unscheduled Hours and / or wish to track specific pay codes for Unscheduled
Hours worked on Holidays or Specific Other Activity Types. Approximately
20 to 40 out of 100 companies require Hours Mapping to meet their Time
and Attendance needs. InfiniTime Administrators attempting
to configure Hours Mapping should have an understanding of Job Costing,
Unscheduled Hours Mapping settings within the Policy, Other Activity Types
and Other Activity Options, as well as a general understanding of the
Payroll Export's use of payroll codes. Related topics are provided below
for reference.

When
configuring Hours Mapping there are three main tasks that must be performed.
Each task is listed and described in detail below.

1. Identify the Type of Hours Mapping that
applies to your scenario.

2.
Identify the Hour Type(s) to be mapped.

3.
Understand how the Hours Mapping Hierarchy will affect your pay premium(s)

1.
Identify the Type of Hours Mapping that applies to your scenario.

InfiniTime
supports five types of Hours Mapping, each of which are configured in
a separate area of the InfiniTime
Application. Hours Mapping Rules are applied for employees assigned to
a specific policy and / or when employees have hours on a specific Other
Activity Type, Department, Job, or Task that has been configured for Hours
Mapping. While it is possible to configure multiple Hours Mapping Types
for a single InfiniTime
Installation, this is only recommended in specific situations in order
to reduce the impact of the Hours Mapping Hierarchy. InfiniTime
Administrators should chose and configure the specific Hours Mapping Type(s)
which best meets the needs of their organization as outlined below.

| Premium Type | Location within InfiniTime | Description |
| Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping | 1. Click on Lookups, Calculations Setup, Policies. 2. Click on the Schedule Settings / Rules Section. 3. Unscheduled Hours Mapping Settings are displayed on the General Tab. | Unscheduled Hours Mapping Settings are applied to all employees assigned to a policy. Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping settings are configured separately for each policy within InfiniTime.  Â   Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to separate all Unscheduled Hours into a single Overtime Bucket such as OT4. |
| Holiday Hours Mapping | 1. Click on Lookups - Calculations Setup - Holiday Schedule Types. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing Holiday Type or click Insert. 3. Click on the Dates Tab. 4. Click Change while highlighting an existing Holiday Date or click Insert. 5. Click on the Hours Mapping Tab. The Hours Mapping Tab is only available for Holiday Dates with 'All Worked Hours are Holiday Pay' = Yes. | Holiday Hours Mapping Settings are applied to all employees assigned to the respective Holiday Type with Worked Hours on the respective Holiday Date.    Holiday Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to separate all Unscheduled Hours worked on a Holiday into a separate bucket such as OT4. |
| Other Activity Hours Mapping | 1. Click on Lookups, Calculations Setup, Other Activity Types. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing Other Activity Type or click Insert. 3. Click on the Hours Mapping Tab. The Hours Mapping Tab is only displayed for Other Activity Types with 'Count as Regular Hours' or 'Only Count as Regular Hours if Scheduled' checked. | Other Activity Hours Mapping Settings are applied to Other Hours for other activity types with Hours Mapping Configured. Other Activity Hours Mapping Settings are configured separately for each Other Activity Type.    Other Activity Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to pay a different rate for hours on a day where the employee was not scheduled to work for other Activity Types set to 'Count as Regular Hours.' The most prevalent scenario that requires Other Activity Hours Mapping is Unscheduled Hours worked on a Holiday Date where All Worked Hours are Holiday Pay is set to No. |
| Department Hours Mapping | 1. Click on the Department Button. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing department or click Insert. 3. Click on the Hours Mapping Tab. | Department Hours Mapping Settings are applied to Worked Hours in a given department and are configured separately for each Department.  Â   Department Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to separate hours worked for a given department into a specific Overtime Bucket to be paid at a premium rate per hour. |
| Job Hours Mapping | 1. Click on Lookups, Employee Setup, Job Costing Lookups, Activity Jobs. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing job or click Insert. 3. Click on the Hours Mapping Tab. | Job Hours Mapping Settings are applied to Worked Hours in a given Job and are configured separately for each Job.  Â   Job Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to separate hours worked for a given job into a specific Overtime Bucket to be paid at a premium rate per hour. |
| Task Hours Mapping | 1. Click on Lookups, Employee Setup, Job Costing Lookups, Activity Tasks. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing task or click Insert. 3. Click on the Hours Mapping Tab. | Task Hours Mapping Settings are applied to Worked Hours in a given Task and are configured separately for each Task.  Â   Task Hours Mapping Settings are commonly used to separate hours worked for a given task into a specific Overtime Bucket to be paid at a premium rate per hour. |

2. Identify
the Hour Type(s) to be mapped.

After
Identifying the Hours Mapping Type, the type of hours to be configured
for Hours Mapping must be identified. Hours Mapping is configured separately
for each type of worked hours. The table below provides an example of
each worked hours type alongside specific policy settings and employee
schedules.

Related
Settings:

The
following policy settings for XYZ Company are utilized for the examples
below.

* OT1
  = Daily > 8 Hours.
* OT2
  = Daily > 10 Hours.
* OT3
  = Day of Week Overtime: Regular, OT1, and OT2 hours worked on Sunday.
* OT4
  = Holiday Hours Mapping: Regular, OT1, and OT2 Hours worked on a Holiday
  Date.

| Working Hours Type | Example |
| Scheduled Regular Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break  Â   Scheduled Regular Hours are Working Hours which do not qualify for any Overtime Bucket that fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours less than 8 in a day are considered Regular Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. All hours worked between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM will be considered Scheduled Hours. |
| Scheduled OT1 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 1 Hour Scheduled OT1  Â   Scheduled OT1 Hours are OT1 Hours that fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours between 8 and 10 in a day are considered OT1 Hours. Hours greater than 10 in a day are OT2 Hours and as such are not OT1 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. All hours worked between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM are considered Scheduled Hours. |
| Scheduled OT2 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 2 Scheduled OT1 Hours, 1 Hour Scheduled OT2  Â   Scheduled OT2 Hours are OT2 Hours that fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours greater than 10 in a day are considered OT2 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. All hours worked between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM are considered Scheduled Hours. |
| Scheduled OT3 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled OT3 Hours  Â   Scheduled OT3 Hours are OT3 Hours that fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, all hours worked on a Sunday are OT3 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. All hours worked between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM are considered Scheduled Hours. |
| Scheduled OT4 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled OT4 Hours  Â   Scheduled OT4 Hours are OT4 Hours that fall within the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, all hours worked on a Holiday Date are OT4 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM on July 4th 2013. All hours worked between 6:00 AM and 3:00 PM are considered Scheduled Hours. |
| Unscheduled Regular Hours | Unscheduled Regular Hours w/ 'Only Hours Worked in Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' disabled    Â   Total Hours: 2 Unscheduled Regular Hours, 6 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break  Â   Unscheduled Regular Hours are Working Hours which do not qualify for any Overtime Bucket that fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours less than 8 in a day are considered Regular Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. All regular hours worked outside of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM will be considered Unscheduled Regular Hours.\*   NOTE: The 'Only Hours Worked in Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' option on the Schedule Settings / Rules section of the policy is intended for organizations who require employees to work at least the scheduled number of hours on a given date prior to receiving Unscheduled Hours. As shown below, if 'Only Hours Worked In Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' employees will only receive Unscheduled Hours for hours beyond the duration of their schedule.  Unscheduled Regular Hours w/ 'Only Hours Worked in Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' enabled    Example 1: Worked Hours Do Not Exceed Scheduled Hours        Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break    When 'Only Hours Worked in Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' is enabled, worked hours must exceed scheduled hours in order for employee's to receive Unscheduled Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM for a total of 8 Working Hours.Â In this scenario, since Regular Hours are Worked Hours Under 8 in a Day, it is not possible for an employee to receive Unscheduled Regular Hours.    Example 2: Worked Hours Exceed Scheduled Hours    Total Hours: 6 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 2 Unscheduled Regular Hours     When 'Only Hours Worked in Excess of Scheduled Hours are Unscheduled' is enabled, worked hours must exceed scheduled hours in order for employee's to receive Unscheduled Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM for a total of 6 Working Hours. In this scenario, since worked hours exceed scheduled hours, the employee receives two hours Unscheduled Regular Hours. |
| Unscheduled OT1 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 1 Hour Unscheduled OT1  Â   Unscheduled OT1 Hours are OT1 Hours that fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours between 8 and 10 in a day are considered OT1 Hours. Hours greater than 10 in a day are OT2 Hours and as such are not OT1 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. All hours worked between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM are considered Unscheduled OT1 Hours. |
| Unscheduled OT2 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled Regular Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 2 Hour Unscheduled OT1, 1 Unscheduled OT2  Â   Unscheduled OT2 Hours are OT2 Hours that fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours over 10 in a day are considered OT2 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM. All hours worked beyond 5:00 PM are considered Unscheduled OT2 Hours. |
| Unscheduled OT3 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled OT3 Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 3 Hours Unscheduled OT3  Â   Unscheduled OT3 Hours are OT3 Hours that fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours worked on a Sunday are considered OT3 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM on Sunday 8/11/13. All hours worked beyond 3:00 PM are considered Unscheduled OT3 Hours. |
| Unscheduled OT4 Hours | Total Hours: 8 Scheduled OT4 Hours, 1 Hour Unpaid Break, 3 Hours Unscheduled OT4  Â Â   Unscheduled OT4 Hours are OT4 Hours that fall outside the bounds of an employee's schedule. In this case, based on the policy settings above, hours worked on a Holiday are considered OT4 Hours. As shown above, the employee is scheduled from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM. All hours worked beyond 3:00 PM are considered Unscheduled OT4 Hours. |

### Example Hours Mapping Configuration:

As
an example for each Hours Mapping Type, let us assume that XYZ Company
pays the Hours Types below at the same rate as Unscheduled OT3. In other
words - Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours can be grouped together
with Unscheduled OT3 Hours and paid together.

The
following Hours Mapping settings are required to map Unscheduled OT1 and
Unscheduled OT2 Hours into OT3:

Scheduled
Hours Mapping Settings:

![](images_2/HoursMapping13.gif)

Unscheduled
Hours Mapping Settings:

![](images_2/HoursMapping14.gif)

The
table below describes when Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours would
be mapped to OT3 if the above settings were configured for each Hours
Mapping Type individually.

| Hours Mapping Type | Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours would be mapped to OT3... |
| Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping | Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours would be mapped directly to OT3 for all employees assigned to the respective policy automatically. No additional actions, such as working on a specific Department / Job / Task or Other Activity Type are required. |
| Holiday Hours Mapping | All Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours *worked on the Holiday Date* would be mapped to OT3. |
| Other Activity Hours Mapping | All Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours *for the respective Other Activity Type* would be mapped to OT3. |
| Department Hours Mapping | All Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours *assigned to the respective Department* would be mapped to OT3. |
| Job Hours Mapping | All Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours *assigned to the respective Job* would be mapped to OT3. |
| Task Hours Mapping | All Unscheduled OT1 and Unscheduled OT2 Hours *assigned to the respective Task* would be mapped to OT3. |

Understand how the Hours Mapping Hierarchy will affects Employee Hours

In some scenarios employees
may be eligible for multiple types of hours mapping by meeting the conditions
of multiple hours mapping settings. If your company will only be tracking
a single type of hours mapping this section can be ignored. When using
multiple hours mapping types, the following key points should be kept
in mind:

* Hours Mapping
  Settings for each Hours Mapping Type are applied sequentially in the
  order below.
* Worked Hours mapped to a different hours type can be mapped
  again by a higher priority Hours Mapping Type.

Sequential Order:

1 Â Â Â Â Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping (Lowest Priority)

2 Â Â Â Â Holiday Hours Mapping

3 Â Â Â Â Other Activity Hours Mapping

4 Â Â Â Â Department Hours
Mapping

5 Â Â Â Â Job Hours Mapping

6 Â Â Â Â Task Hours Mapping
(Highest Priority)

For example, ABC Manufacturing Company
pays Unscheduled Hours on Holiday Dates at a different rate than Unscheduled
Hours on regular working days for Production Employees. The hours mapping
settings shown below will map Unscheduled Regular and OT1 Hours to OT2
for all employees assigned to the Production Employees policy. Additionally,
if an employees on the Production Employee's policy work Unscheduled Regular
or OT1 Hours on a Holiday Date the Unscheduled OT2 Hours will be posted
to OT4.

| ABC Manufacturing Company - Hours Mapping Settings | |
| Hours Mapping Type | Hours Mapping Settings |
| Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping | * Scheduled Hours:  + N/A  * Unscheduled Hours:  + Unscheduled Regular HoursOT2 + Unscheduled OT1 HoursOT2 |
| Holiday Hours Mapping | * Scheduled Hours:  + N/A  * Unscheduled Hours:  + Unscheduled OT2 HoursOT4 |

ABC Manufacturing - Policy
Unscheduled Hours Mapping Example:

![](images_2/HoursMapping15.gif)

July 6th 2013 is a normal
scheduled working day for John Smith. Notice how John worked a total of
10 hours with 2 Unscheduled OT1 hours posting to OT2 due to Policy Unscheduled
Hours Mapping Settings.

ABC Manufacturing - Holiday
Hours Mapping Example:

![](images_2/HoursMapping16.gif)

July
4th 2013 is a scheduled working day for John Smith that also happens to
be a Holiday Date. Notice how John worked a total of 10 hours with 2 Unscheduled
OT1 hours. However - instead of posting to OT2 Unscheduled OT1 Hours are
posted to OT4 due to both Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping Settings and
Holiday Hours Mapping Settings. This occurs because the Holiday Hours
Mapping Type is higher priority than the Policy Unscheduled Hours Mapping
Type.

### Pay Premiums Introduction

Premium Pay makes it possible to define
Premiums, or bonuses in the form of an increased wage, which are paid
to employees based upon the Shift, Department, Job, or Task the employee
works on. Premiums can be configured separately for the Regular, Overtime
One, Overtime Two, Overtime Three, and Overtime Four hour types. This
flexibility makes it possible to meet the needs of a variety of special
payment scenarios. Â Pay Premiums are optional and are intended for
special scenarios that require specific rules for Medical, Union, and
Manufacturing employees. Approximately 20 to 40 out of 100 companies (20%
- 40%) require Premium Pay to calculate wages appropriately for employees.

When
configuring Premium Pay there are four main tasks that must be performed.
Each task is listed and described in detail below.

[1. Identify
the Type of Premium.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#pp_context_PremiumType)

[2. Identify
the Hour Type(s) eligible for the premium.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#pp_context_2_HoursTypes)

[3. Identify
an appropriate Pay Method.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#pp_context_3_PayMethod)

[4. Understand
how the Premium Hierarchy will affect your pay premium(s)](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Configuration/Product_Configuration.md#pp_context_4_Hierarchy)

### Identifying the Type of Premium

InfiniTime
supports five types of premiums, each of which are configured in a separate
area of the InfiniTime
Application. Employees receive premium pay when they work in a Shift,
Department, Job, Task, or Hours Type that has been configured with a premium.
While it is possible to configure multiple Premium Types and Pay Methods
for a single InfiniTime
Installation, it is recommended that only a single premium type be configured
to reduce the impact of the Premium Type Hierarchy. InfiniTime
Administrators should chose and configure the single Premium Type which
best meets the needs of your organization as outlined below. Selecting
the type of premium is best explained through example. Many hospitals
pay employees filling the role of Head Nurse, or the nurse who oversees
all other nurses for a given shift, an additional premium. To determine
the necessary type of premium the user must understand how the role of
head nurse is tracked within InfiniTime.
If Head Nurse is a department which employees punch into when they fill
the Head Nurse role then the premium would be configured on the Head Nurse
department. Similarly, if Head Nurse was a Job or Task then the premium
would be configured on the Job or Task respectively.

| Premium Type | Location within InfiniTime | Description |
| Shift Differentials | 1. Click on Lookups, Scheduling Setup, Shifts. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing shift or click Insert. 3.Check the box labeled 'Used for Differential' 4. Click on the Differential Pay Tab. | Shift differentials are periods of time during which employees receive bonuses in the form of additional pay. Employees working during the hours defined by the shift differential will receive shift differential pay. |
| Department Premiums | 1. Click on the Department Button. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing department or click Insert. 3. Click on the Premium Pay Tab. | Department premiums are configured separately for each department in InfiniTime. Employees will receive Department Premiums when working in a department configured with a Premium. |
| Job Premiums | 1. Click on Lookups, Employee Setup, Job Costing Lookups, Activity Jobs. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing job or click Insert. 3. Click on the Premium Pay Tab. | Job premiums are configured separately for each Job in InfiniTime. Employees will receive Job Premiums when working in a Job configured with a Premium. |
| Task Premiums | 1. Click on Lookups, Employee Setup, Job Costing Lookups, Activity Tasks. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing task or click Insert. 3. Click on the Premium Pay Tab. | Task premiums are configured separately for each Task in InfiniTime. Employees will receive Task Premiums when working in a Task configured with a Premium. |
| Overtime Premiums | 1. Click on Company, Setup, Policies. 2. Click Change while highlighting an existing policy or click Insert. 3. Click on Overtime Rules.  [Refer to Overtime Settings for more information on Overtime Pay Methods.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overtime_Settings.md) | Overtime Premiums are configured separately for each Overtime Type from OT1 to OT4. Employees will receive Overtime Premiums for any Overtime Type with a premium configured. For example, if a premium is set for OT1, any OT1 hours will be calculated as Premium Pay. |

Identify
the Hours Type(s) eligible for the premium

After identifying the
Premium Type, the type of hours eligible for premium must be identified.
Premiums are configured separately for each type of hours from Regular
and Overtime 1 to Overtime 4. Again, this concept is best illustrated
through example. Two examples are provided below for clarity. Remember,
any combination of premiums can be used to meet the user's needs. The
examples below are simply example scenarios.

Regular
and Overtime 1 Hours in the Head Nurse Department receive Premium Pay

If both regular and
overtime 1 hours in the Head Nurse department receive premium pay then
the premium must be configured separately for both Regular Hours and Overtime
1 hours as shown. The example below uses an Amount Pay Method which pays
employees an additional dollar amount for every hour eligible for the
premium. In the example, Regular Hours worked as a Head Nurse receive
an additional dollar per hour while Overtime Hours receive an additional
two dollars per hour.

![](images_2/DeptPrem_EX_1.gif)

![](images_2/DeptPrem_EX_2.gif)

Only Overtime 1 Hours in the Head Nurse Department
receive Premium Pay

If
only Overtime 1 hours in the Head Nurse department receive premium pay
then the premium should only be configured for Overtime 1 hours as shown.
The example below uses an Amount Pay Method which pays employees an additional
dollar amount for every hour eligible for the premium. In the example,
Overtime hours worked as a Head Nurse receive an additional two dollars
per hour while Regular Hours do not receive a premium and are paid at
the employee's base wage.

![](images_2/DeptPrem_EX_3.gif)

![](images_2/DeptPrem_EX_4.gif)

Identify
an appropriate Pay Method

![](images_2/PREMPayMethods.gif)

When
configuring Pay Premiums be sure to select the Pay Method that matches
your needs. InfiniTime
supports three separate pay methods as listed below. Pay special attention
to the labels and units on the form when selecting Pay Premiums. If 'None'
is selected in the Premium Pay Drop Down a premium will not be applied
for the Hours Type.

Amount Pay Method

The
Amount Pay Method pays employees an additional dollar amount for each
hour they work. For example, an amount of 5.00 as shown below will pay
employees their default wage plus an additional five dollars per hour
for Regular Hours worked on the Department.. An example calculation is
below.

Employee
Default Wage + Dollar Amount = Hourly Wage

$10.00
+ $5.00 = Hourly Wage

$15.00
= Hourly Wage

![](images_2/DeptPremium_Amt.gif)

Percent Pay Method

The
Percent Pay Method pays employees an additional percentage of their default
wage for each hour they work. For example, a percent wage increase of
50 Percent is equivalent to Time and a Half or 1.5 times the employee's
default wage. An example calculation is below.

Employee
Default Wage + (Employee Default Wage \* Percent Wage Increase) = Hourly
Wage

$10.00
+ ($10.00 \* 50%) = Hourly Wage

$10.00
+ ($5.00) = Hourly Wage

$15.00
= Hourly Wage

![](images_2/DeptPremium_Percent.gif)

Rate Pay Method

The
Rate Pay Method defines a specific wage for overtime hours. When the Rate
Pay Method is used employee default wages are ignored and the Premium
Rate is used for overtime hours.

![](images_2/DeptPremium_Rate.gif)

WARNING:
The Rate Pay Method is not a multiplier
of the employee's wage. Selecting the Rate Pay Method and entering 1.5
as the Overtime Rate will pay the employee $1.50 per hour. Remember, the
Employee's default wage is ignored when the Rate Pay Method is selected.
The Overtime Rate is entered in dollars per hour and will be used as the
employee's overtime wage.

Understand how
the Premium Hierarchy will affect your pay premium(s)

In some scenarios employees
may be eligible for multiple types of premium pay for the same hours type
at the same time by meeting the conditions of multiple premium types.
If your company will only be tracking a single type of premium pay this
section can be ignored. Premiums are applied in a predefined order, beginning
with an employee's base rate. The base rate is determined by either the
Default Wage on the employee's HR Profile Tab or by Wages defined in the
employee's Wages Table. Refer to the [Wages
Section](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Employee_Setup/Wages.md) of this document for more information on Employee Wages.

After InfiniTime determines an employee's
base rate Premium Pay is applied in order as listed below. Shift differentials
are considered separate from Premium Pay. Employees who qualify for Shift
Differential Pay will not receive additional pay from Department, Job,
Task, or Policy based Premiums. Example calculations and scenarios are
provided below to illustrate the Premium Pay Hierarchy. There are two
things to keep in mind:

* Premiums
  of the Amount and Percent Pay Methods are cumulative.
* Higher
  priority Premiums of the Rate Pay Method will override lower priority
  premiums.
* Higher
  priority Premiums of the Amount and Percent Pay Method will build
  on top of lower priority rate premiums.

Premium Hierarchy

1.
Department Premiums are applied. (Lowest Priority)

2.
Job Premiums are applied

3.
Task Premiums are applied.

4.
Policy Overtime Premiums are applied. (Highest Priority)

Note: Premiums are listed from lowest priority
to highest priority.

Amount Pay
Method

Premiums of the amount
pay method are cumulative. For example, the equations below show how each
type of premium would be applied to an employee's base rate if an employee
were to meet the requirements of Department, Job, Task, and Policy Overtime
premiums each configured with the Amount Pay method.

* Department Premium: Â Â Amt
  + WAGE = DWAGE
* Job Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + DWAGE = JWAGE
* Task Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + JWage = TWAGE
* Policy Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + TWAGE = Â Hourly Wage

| Ex.# | Base Rate | Department Premium Amount | Job Premium Amount | Task Premium Amount | Policy Overtime Premium Amount |
| 1 | $10.00 | $0.50 | $0.25 | $0.25 | $1.00 |
| 2 | $15.00 | $0.50 | $0.50 | $0.25 | $0.50 |

Note: Values from the table are used in the examples
below.

Example 1

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $0.50 + $10.00 | $10.50 |
| JOB | $0.25 + $10.50 | $10.75 |
| TASK | $0.25 + $10.75 | $11.00 |
| POLICY | $0.50 + $11.00 | $11.50 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Example 2

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $0.50 + $15.00 | $15.50 |
| JOB | $0.50 + $15.50 | $16.00 |
| TASK | $0.25 + $16.00 | $16.25 |
| POLICY | $0.50 + $16.25 | $16.75 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Percent Pay
Method

Premiums
of the Percent pay method are cumulative. For example, the equations below
show how each type of premium would be applied to an employee's base rate
if an employee were to meet the requirements of Department, Job, Task,
and Policy Overtime premiums each configured with the Percent Pay method.

* Department Premium: Â Â Â (%
  \* WAGE) + WAGE = DWAGE
* Job Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (%
  \* DWAGE) + DWAGE = JWAGE
* Task Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (%
  \* JWAGE) + JWage = TWAGE
* Policy Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (%
  \* TWAGE) + TWAGE = Hourly Wage

| Ex.# | Base Rate | Department Premium Percent | Job Premium Percent | Task Premium Percent | Policy Overtime Premium Percent |
| 1 | $10.00 | 5% | 10% | 10% | 15% |
| 2 | $15.00 | 5% | 5% | 5% | 15% |

Note: Values from the table are used in the examples
below.

Example 1

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | (.05 \* $10.00) + $10.00 | $10.50 |
| JOB | (.10 \* $10.50) + $10.50 | $11.55 |
| TASK | (.10 \* $11.55) + $11.55 | $12.71 |
| POLICY | (.15 \* $12.71) + $12.71 | $14.62 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Example 2

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | (.05 \* $15.00) + $15.00 | $15.75 |
| JOB | (.05 \* $15.75) + $15.75 | $16.54 |
| TASK | (.05 \* $16.54) + $16.54 | $17.37 |
| POLICY | (.15 \* $17.37) + $17.37 | $19.98 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Rate Pay Method

Premiums
of the Percent pay method are not cumulative. Higher priority premiums
simply override lower priority premiums. For example, the equations below
show how each type of premium would be applied to an employee's base rate
if an employee were to meet the requirements of Department, Job, Task,
and Policy Overtime premiums each configured with the Rate Pay method.

* Department Premium: Rate = DWAGE
* Job Premium: Rate = JWAGE
* Task Premium: Rate = TWAGE
* Policy Premium: Rate = Hourly
  Wage

| Ex.# | Base Rate | Department Premium Rate | Job Premium Rate | Task Premium Rate | Policy Overtime Premium Rate |
| 1 | $10.00 | $8.00 | $8.50 | $9.00 | $9.50 |
| 2 | $15.00 | $16.00 | $18.00 | $19.00 | $20.00 |

Note: Values from the table are used in the examples
below.

Example 1

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $8.00 = Hourly Wage | $8.00 |
| JOB | $8.50 = Hourly Wage | $8.50 |
| TASK | $9.00 = Hourly Wage | $9.00 |
| POLICY | $9.50 = Hourly Wage | $9.50 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Example 2

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $16.00 = Hourly Wage | $16.00 |
| JOB | $18.00 = Hourly Wage | $18.00 |
| TASK | $19.00 = Hourly Wage | $19.00 |
| POLICY | $20.00 = Hourly Wage | $20.00 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Additional Example: Rate Pay Method Overrides
lower Priority Premiums

Remember,
Premiums of the Rate Pay Method will override lower priority premiums.
An example of this concept is provided below.

* Department Premium: Â Â Amt
  + WAGE = DWAGE
* Job Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + DWAGE = JWAGE
* Task Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + JWage = TWAGE
* Policy Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Rate
  = Â Hourly Wage

| Ex.# | Base Rate | Department Premium Amount | Job Premium Amount | Task Premium Amount | Policy Overtime Premium Rate |
| 1 | $10.00 | $0.50 | $0.25 | $0.25 | $14.00 |
| 2 | $15.00 | $0.50 | $0.50 | $0.25 | $19.00 |

Note: Values from the table
are used in the examples below.

Example 1

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $0.50 + $10.00 | $10.50 |
| JOB | $0.25 + $10.50 | $10.75 |
| TASK | $0.25 + $10.75 | $11.00 |
| POLICY | $14.00 = Hourly Wage | $14.00 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Example 2

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $0.50 + $15.00 | $15.50 |
| JOB | $0.50 + $15.50 | $16.00 |
| TASK | $0.25 + $16.00 | $16.25 |
| POLICY | $19.00 = Hourly Wage | $19.00 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

Additional Example: Amount and Percent Pay Methods
build on top of lower priority rate premiums

Remember,
Premiums of the Amount and Percent Pay Methods will build on lower priority
rate premiums. An example of this concept is provided below.

* Department Premium: Â Â Rate
  = DWAGE
* Job Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + DWAGE = JWAGE
* Task Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Amt
  + JWage = TWAGE
* Policy Premium: Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Rate
  = Â Hourly Wage

| Ex.# | Base Rate | Department Premium Rate | Job Premium Amount | Task Premium Amount | Policy Overtime Premium Amount |
| 1 | $10.00 | $12.00 | $0.25 | $0.25 | $1.00 |
| 2 | $15.00 | $17.00 | $0.50 | $0.25 | $1.00 |

Note: Values from the table
are used in the examples below.

Example 1

| Premium Type | Calculation | Resulting Hourly Wage |
| DEPT | $12.00 = Hourly Wage | $12.00 |
| JOB | $0.25 + $12.00 | $12.25 |
| TASK | $0.25 + $12.25 | $12.50 |
| POLICY | $1.00 + $12.50 | $13.50 |

Note: The Hourly Wage shown in bold is the final
wage after all premiums are applied. The employee would be paid the final
wage for any hours qualifying for all premiums.

### Shift Differentials

Shift differentials can be configured in order to compensate employees
for working undesirable shifts. InfiniTime
provides incredible flexibility when configuring shift differentials through
multiple payment methods, as configured in the policies, and various differential
pay options. These options are outlined below. Additional details on the
use and configuration of Shift Differentials can be found in the [Scheduling Section of this
document.](/InfiniTime/help%20file/Overview/Scheduling/Scheduling.md#dif01_Shifts_for_Differential_Purposes)

![](images_2/Shift_Diferential_Tab.gif)

These fields will allow you to assign a differential pay based on the
type of hours.

Differential Pay
- Â This drop down box allows you to select the type of pay. Â The
options are rate, amount, and percentage.

![](images_2/Differential-Pay.gif)

Amount - Selecting
amount specifies that the value entered into the differential pay amount
field is a dollar value, which will be added to the employees base wage
as specified in the employees record.

Example:

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Amount: $1.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $16.00

![](images_2/sched8.gif)

Percent - Selecting
percent specifies that the value entered into the differential pay amount
field is a percentage value, which will be multiplied by the employees
base wage to determine the additional amount paid during differential
time.

Example:

Employee Base Wage: $10.00

Differential Percent: 20%

Additional Differential Pay Amount: $2.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $12.00

![](images_2/sched7.gif)

Rate -
Selecting rate specifies that the value entered into the differential
pay amount field is a dollar value, which will be considered the total
hourly pay during differential time. The Employee's base wage is ignored
when a rate is specified. All employees will receive the same pay rate
when they qualify for differential time.

Example:

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Rate: $18.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $18.00

![](images_2/sched9.gif)

Differential Pay
Amount - This field will allow you to enter the amount of the pay
according to the selected differential pay type, for example, if you had
selected amount for differential pay a dollar amount would be entered
into this field. Refer to the above examples for usage.

![](images_2/Differential-Pay-Amount.gif)

Before Shift Grace
Differential (Optional)Ã¢ÂÂ This is the amount of time the employee
has before the shift starts to clock in and be considered to be in that
shift for differential purposes.

After Shift Grace
Period (Optional)Ã¢ÂÂ This is the amount of time the employee has
after the shift has started to clock in and still be considered in that
shift for differential purposes.

Map Shift Hours
To Ã¢ÂÂ Allows versatile shift differential payment methods. Shift
Differential mapping makes it possible to pay shift differential hours
according to the hours on another shift. Shift mapping is subject to the
following requirements and conditions:

Two Shifts must be configured for differential.
Use for differential must be checked for each shift.

1 Primary Differential Shift

1 Secondary Differential Shift

The Primary differential shift contains the
map to setting, which points to the Secondary Differential Shift. The
employee must work the hours as defined on the Primary Differential Shift
in order to qualify for differential payment. Differential hours will
be paid according to the Differential Pay and Differential Amount settings
defined on the Secondary Differential Shift. Differential Pay and Differential
Amount Settings can be left blank on the Primary Differential Shift.

The Secondary Differential Shift determines
hours to be paid as differential. When an employee qualifies for differential
payment on the Primary Differential Shift the employee will be paid according
to the hours on the Secondary Differential Shift.

Zone
- Zone pays shift differential according to the period an employee
is working. The employee in question worked from 4:00 PM to 12:00 AM.
By working 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM the employee qualifies for the mapped shift
differential. Of the total hours worked six hours (4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 10:00 PM)
qualify for differential payment and two hours (10:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM) are
considered regular time, or outside of the differential period.

Employee Work Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Amount: $1.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $16.00

Qualifying Differential Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ
10:00 PM (6 Hours)

Regular Pay Hours: 10:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM (2
Hours)

Total Differential Pay: $16.00 \* 6 Hours
= $96.00

Total Regular Pay: $15.00 \* 2 Hours = $30.00

Total Pay: $126.00

Clock
In - Clock in pays shift differential according to where the employee
clocks in. The employee in question clocked in at 4:00 PM, which falls
within a period defined for differential payment. All hours are paid at
the differential rate defined in the Secondary Differential Policy since
mapping is being used.

Employee Work Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Amount: $1.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $16.00

Qualifying Differential Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ
12:00 PM (8 Hours)

Regular Pay Hours: 0

Total Differential Pay: $16.00 \* 8 Hours
= $128.00

Total Regular Pay: $15.00 \* 0 Hours = $0.00

Total Pay: $128.00

Clock
Out - Clock out pays shift differential according to where the
employee clocks out. The employee in question clocked out at 12:00 AM,
which does not fall within a period defined for differential payment.

Employee Work Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Amount: $1.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $16.00

Qualifying Differential Hours: 0 Hours

Regular Pay Hours: 8

Total Differential Pay: $16.00 \* 0 Hours
= $0.00

Total Regular Pay: $15.00 \* 8 Hours = $120.00

Total Pay: $120.00

Majority
- Majority hours pays shift differential according to where the
employee spent the most hours. By working from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM the
employee in question qualifies for the mapped shift differential, which
provides the employee with 6 hours differential time and 2 hours regular
time under zone circumstances. In this scenario, the employee has majority
hours in differential time. All hours are paid at the differential rate.

Employee Work Hours: 4:00 PM Ã¢ÂÂ 12:00 AM

Employee Base Wage: $15.00

Differential Amount: $1.00

Total Hourly Differential Pay Rate: $16.00

## InfiniTime Configuration - Takeaways & Essential Concepts

As a versatile Time and Attendance Solution with the ability to meet
the needs of enterprise organizations with a single location to organizations
with multiple locations and unique requirements InfiniTime
offers a variety of features. It is important to note that nearly all
features within the InfiniTime
Time and Attendance application are optional and can be configured or
ignored (IE: Disabled) to meet the needs of the organization. With this
in mind, the table below provides a list of specific features that must
be configured in order to successfully transfer employee hours and earnings
to a Payroll Application - either manually using InfiniTime
Reports and Data Entry or automatically using the InfiniTime
Payroll Export Feature. For clarity, each feature and its place in the
day to day operational use of InfiniTime,
or process flow, is also provided below.

InfiniTime Day to Day Operational
Use - Maintenance Tasks

During normal day to day business operations, certain events will require
InfiniTime Software Administrators,
Payroll Clerks, and / or Supervisors to take specific actions within InfiniTime. Several such tasks are
outlined below.

| Event | Task Description |
| Employee Turnover | * When an employee is terminated, their employee record should   be set to Inactive. Inactive Employee records do not count   toward the maximum employee count per your organization's   InfiniTime   Software License. |
| New Hire | * When a new employee is hired, they must be added to the   InfiniTime   Software using the Employee Table. Alternatively, employee   records may also be imported using the Import Tool. After   adding a new employee, be sure to assign all settings (Security   Role, Policy, Department / Job / Task, Holiday Type, Accrual   Type, Groups etc.) to the employee as appropriate. |
| New Year | * Holiday Dates within InfiniTime   are configured on a year by year basis. Holiday Dates must   be configured for each Calendar Date on which employees receive   benefits. Refer to the Holidays Section of this document for   additional details on configuring Holiday Dates. |
| Change in Time and Attendance or Paid / Unpaid Leave Policies | * Review and Alter InfiniTime   Policies, Holidays, Accruals, Other Activity Types, and /   or Schedules to reflect your organization's new rule set. |
| Employee Hours and Earnings Exported by InfiniTime do not match those exported from the existing Time and Attendance Solution during the Parallel Payroll Run | * Review Employee Timecards. Ensure timecards match in both   systems. * Review Other Activity Types within InfiniTime.   One or more Hours and Earning Types may exist in the Current   Time and Attendance System that were not added to InfiniTime. * Review Policy Configuration within InfiniTime.   Policy settings may need to be adjusted and fine tuned during   the few Payroll Periods. |

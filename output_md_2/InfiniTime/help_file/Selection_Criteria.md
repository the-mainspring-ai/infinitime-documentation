Selection Criteria




# Selection Criteria

The selection criteria tab employs various filters in order to select what employees will be included in the report. It is important to note that employees must meet all selection criteria in order to be present in the report. For example, if a certain group and department are selected, only employees within the specified group and department will be printed in the report. The selection criteria are configured to print for all employees by default.

*Note*:  It is not uncommon for users to Choose âSelectedâ in order to specify individual employees, departments, jobs, tasks or groups and then forget to tag specific employees, departments,  jobs, tasks or groups. Employees are not selected if a green checkmark is not displayed to the left of their name. Should selected be chosen, and no employees specified, selection criteria will automatically revert to the âAllâ selection in order to avoid an error.
